MonoTouch IDE
=============

The [MonoTouch]({{ site.github.url }}/MonoTouch "MonoTouch") toolchain can be used with any editor, XCode or it can be used with MonoDevelop. You will typically pick the IDE that better suits your needs.

If you are building a new project from scratch, you will likely use MonoDevelop to take advantage of our advanced C\# code-completion and Mono integration. If you are integrating Mono and MonoTouch into an existing application, you will likely keep your code in XCode and merge the two worlds together using Mono's embedding APIs.

Additionally, if you are integrating MonoTouch into an existing build system, you might want to read on [the command line tools available](#command-line-integration).
