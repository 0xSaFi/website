Olive
=====

Olive is a set of add-on libraries for the Mono core that bring some of the new .NET APIs to Mono.

Olive is unsupported, should be considered as experimental software, and since it implements a shifting API there are no guarantees of any kind about the stability of the API.

Currently Olive contains:

-   [Workflow]({{ site.github.url }}/Workflow "Workflow") 3.5 APIs
-   [PresentationFoundation](/index.php?title=PresentationFoundation&action=edit&redlink=1 "PresentationFoundation (page does not exist)") and [WindowsBase](/index.php?title=WindowsBase&action=edit&redlink=1 "WindowsBase (page does not exist)") (only [XAML](/index.php?title=XAML&action=edit&redlink=1 "XAML (page does not exist)") support)
