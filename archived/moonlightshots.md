A Modified Surface page, June 19th, 2007

Jackson and Sebastien got Paths working, this is from Sam Ruby's [SVG to Silverlight page](http://intertwingly.net/stories/2007/05/06/?icon=caution). This in particular shows a sample that renders on Silverlight but fails with SVG:

This shows two videos playing, and they are being scaled and rotated (together with a rectangle that has radiusx/radiusy set and has a transparent filling). At this time animation is done with the Storyboard, with a couple of DoubleAnimations on a Timeline:

This was the first screenshot, video is rotated, but as you can see the video was not being decoded properly (libswscale renders to a different format than Cairo expected), the image is rotating:
