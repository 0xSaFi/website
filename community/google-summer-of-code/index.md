Google Summer of Code
=====================

[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](http://code.google.com/soc/) is a program that offers student developers stipends to write code for various open source projects. Google will be working with several open source, free software, and technology-related groups to identify and fund several projects over a three month period.

Please note that to apply for GSoC, you will need to go through the standard Google application process. You do not apply directly to the Mono Project. Any questions or comments about this program can be sent to soc@xamarin.com.
