This is the Mono Project's project ideas page. For general information and rules about participating in
[Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](http://code.google.com/soc/) for the Mono Project, please see our
[overview page](/community/google-summer-of-code/).

This page lists some ideas for Mono GSoC projects that students can apply for. Additionally, we encourage students
to submit their own interesting Mono-related project proposals. In past years, roughly 20% of the accepted
proposals were original ideas from students instead of from our suggestions. You can submit more than one proposal,
so you can submit your own ideas as well as apply for one from this list - but only one can be chosen, of course!

How to get in touch with us and ask questions

## MonoDevelop / Xamarin Studio IDE

### Code Contracts Support

**Complexity:** Medium

The goal of this project is to add Code COntracts support to Mono using the open-source [.NET Code Code Contracts support](https://github.com/Microsoft/CodeContracts).

For more information, see:

* https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd264808%28v=vs.110%29.aspx
* http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/contracts/

This is a technology that is made of four components:

* APIs in mscorlib that are used to specify things like preconditions and post conditions
* The use of these APIs in user code
* Tools to modify binaries to insert/remove code contracts instrumentation
* IDE support for the tools.

We have already done the first step, and as we import more code from .NET, the second step will be done for us in the core libraries.

This task focuses on two things:

* Porting the tools to modify binaries to insert/remove code
* IDE support for the tools

The first step should be relatively simple.   The code is open source, and might require some minimal changes to run on Unix with Mono.

The second step includes extending the MonoDevelop IDE to add the configuration options to use Code Contracts and call the code contract tools at the appropriate times. The UI looks like the attached screenshot, and under the hood it works using MSBuild targets.

**Deliverables**: Code contracts tools working on Mono and integrated into MonoDevelop.

**Mentors:** Aleksey Kliger

### Codelens for MD

**Complexity:** Easy

The monodevelop editor has support for extending lines e.g. drawing stuff above or below lines.

Visual Studio.NET introduced code lenses which does exactly that. The task would be to create an infrastructure for these code lenses and implement some proof of concept lenses. References & Authors at least. 

The lenses should be extendable by other addins. You'll learn about the extension mechanism we use as well as drawing with cairo using C#/Mono. The underpinnings are already implemented it's just gluing the stuff together.

**Mentors:** maryannexe

### Debugging disassembled code could use C# decompiler to generate source

**Complexity:** Medium

MonoDevelop already has IL->C# logic, and the debugger already supports stepping into methods without code. These two components have to be combined to give a user the option to see C# code instead of IL when stepping into methods without source code.

**Deliverables:** Ability to see C# instead of IL when debugging methods without source code.

**Mentors:** David Karlas

### Improve Auto-Documentation System

**Complexity:** Medium

MonoDevelop has an addin that automatically generates documentation comments based on the member types and  naming conventions. This is very useful, as it gets the boilerplate out the way leaving more time for the developer to add meaningful details.

However, sometimes its assumptions do not hold and the resulting docs  do not make sense. Although this is funny, we would like to fix it.

This is an ideal project for a student interested in linguistics, parsing & understanding natural language.

Your proposal should describe the approaches you intend to use to fix the issue, and a number of cases where the generated docs could be improved.

**Deliverables:** Fix the docs generation for the cases covered in your proposal.

**Mentors:** Mike Kr√ºger

### Overhaul MD database addins

**Complexity:** Medium

Take the database addins from MonoDevelop core, update them to MD6 API. Remove all the backends except Sqlite, MySQL and PostgreSQL. Ship then as standalone addins. Add a unit test suite. Fix bugs (check bugzilla) and add general polish and features (to be proposed by student).

**Mentors:** Marius Ungureanu

### Reuse MonoDevelop Roslyn compilation to perform compile

**Complexity:** Medium

MonoDevelop now uses the Roslyn compiler for its type system, and keeps fully updated Roslyn compilations in memory. It should be possible when building for the build engine to connect back the the IDE and use the existing Roslyn compilations for code generation, in the same way that Visual Studio does. This will greatly improve compile time during development.

This will require implementing the MSBuild ICscHostObject interface in the MonoDevelop build system and having the Csc build task delegate the code generation to the in-process compiler.

**Deliverables**: Fully implement ICscHostObject in the MonoDevelop build system, including tests.

**Mentors:** Marius Ungureanu

### Support for Symbol Servers

**Complexity:** Hard

Support for downloading symbol packages from symbol servers on demand and using them in the debugger. This is primarily useful for NuGet.

Making this work will require implementing support for handling debugger symbols on the client (IDE) side instead of the debugger agent.

**Deliverables**: Support for downloading symbol packages and using them when debugging apps.

**Mentors:** David Karlas

### Unit tests code coverage visualised inside MonoDevelop editor

**Complexity:** Medium

The [monocov](https://github.com/mono/monocov) profiler module can be used to collect information about which code was executed. This project would involve adding support to the MonoDevelop.UnitTesting extension to collect code coverage information when running unit tests on the Mono runtime, and to display that information in a pad and visually in the source editor.

**Deliverables**: Add support to MonoDevelop to collect code coverage information when running tests, and display it visually in the text editor.

**Mentors:** David Karlas

### Urho3D Material Editor for MonoDevelop

**Complexity:** Medium

Urho3D is an open source game engine that C#/F# developers can use via the [UrhoSharp](https://github.com/xamarin/urho) binding. It's small and easily embeddeable, and thus suitable for visualization as well as games.

It would be very useful for developers using MonoDevelop to be able to edit Urho3D materials definitions directly within their project. The editor should have code completion and validation for the material format, and a way to preview the material live as is is edited.

**Deliverables**: An Urho3D material editor embedded into MonoDevelop that allows developers to preview and edit materials that are in their projects.

**Mentors:** Mikayla Hutchinson, Miguel de Icaza

### Urho3D Scene Editor for MonoDevelop

**Complexity:** Medium

Urho3D is an open source game engine that C#/F# developers can use via the [UrhoSharp](https://github.com/xamarin/urho) binding. It's small and easily embeddeable, and thus suitable for visualization as well as games.

It would be very useful for developers using MonoDevelop to be able to edit Urho3D scene definitions directly within their project. This editor should allow placing objects in the scene; moving, scaling and rotating; and editing properties such as materials and components.

**Deliverables**: An Urho3D scene editor embedded into MonoDevelop that allows developers to preview and edit scenes that are in their projects.

**Mentors:** Mikayla Hutchinson

### Visual Basic with Roslyn in MD

**Complexity:** Medium

Overhaul the VB language binding addin or rewrite it from scratch and
make use of the full VB .NET support in Roslyn (without mono-basic). The CSharpBinding addin is a good starting point and reference.

Main goals:

* Compatibility with Visual Studio projects
* Panels for editing all project options
* Updated project templates
* Integration into the MonoDevelop type system
* Code completion ported from Roslyn EditorFeatures
* Other standard IDE language integration (code folding, document outline, symbol tooltips, Find References, etc)

Optional:

* Mac/Linux support (depends on MSBuild and Roslyn compilers being included in Mono)
* VB.NET source analysis
* VB.NET refactorings ported from Roslyn EditorFeatures
* Semantic highlighting

**Deliverables**: VB.NET support in MonoDevelop with updated project options and templates, and Roslyn-based code completion

**Mentors:** Vsevolod Kukol, Marius Ungureanu

## Compilers and Tools

### Bring IronPython to Android and iOS.

**Complexity:** Medium

IronPython has been maintained all of this years, and with the increased popularity of Python in schools, we would like to add bring IronPython to mobile platforms.

The goal of this project would include:

* Adjust IronPython to compile with Xamarin's mobile profiles (Android or iOS).
* Define a launcher for Android or iOS to start IronPython from the existing C# shell
* Define the MSBuild project system for IronPython

**Mentors:** Miguel de Icaza, Mikayla Hutchinson

### Port ilasm to use IKVM.Reflection instead of PEAPI.

**Complexity:** Medium

Port ilasm, the IL assembler, to use IKVM.Reflection as its code emission backend instead of PEAPI. This will require extending IKVM.Reflection to support the advanced metadata that ilasm supports.

**Deliverables:** ilasm emitting code using IKVM.Reflection instead of PEAPI, and passing all tests.

**Mentors:** Marek Safar, Zoltan Varga

## Mono Runtime

### Add platform specific backends for the ThreadPool

**Complexity:** Medium

The ThreadPool supports the concept of workers backend which is responsible for allocating the appropriate number of threads. This allows for platform-specific implementations. For example, we can use  `dispatch_async` on macOS/iOS, the Win32 threadpool on Windows, and the existing - hand rolled - implementation on the other platforms.

**Deliverables:** Add backend for `dispatch_async` on macOS/iOS and for the Win32 threadpool on Windows.

**Mentors:** Ludovic Henry

### Allocator for sgen blocks

**Complexity:** Hard

Most of the objects in sgen are allocated in major blocks. We don't allocate the blocks in an organised way, we allocate them in chunks and free them individually. This leads to incapability of freeing them on some targets, virtual space fragmentation and bad structure.

We need to allocate blocks in well determined contiguous regions that we can keep track of and have sgen's compaction mechanism account for this structure.

**Deliverables** : Implement an allocator for sgen blocks

**Mentors:** Vlad Brezae

### Implement a LLDB plugin that can understands the mono runtime

**Complexity:** Hard

LLDB support plugins and we should write one that exposes as much as possible of the runtime. A few ideas:

* object layout, introspection and heap walking
* unwinding and symbolifying managed methods
* lookup line information for managed methods
* pretty print all runtime structs
* threadpool introspection?

Note that some work on this has been done already and can be found [here](https://github.com/mono/lldb) and [here](https://github.com/mono/lldb-binaries).

**Deliverables:** One or more of the above bullet points, as listed in your proposals.

**Mentors:** Alexis Christoforides

### Implement Clang static analyser checkers that would verify runtime invariants

**Complexity:** Medium

Clang static analyser support writing custom rules.

Add new rules that understand idioms in the runtime (and maybe extra hints on it) to verify multiple conditions:

* Managed exception cleaningness;
* Managed allocation OOM handling;
* Correct lock ordering;
* GC invariants;
* AppDomain invariants;

Together with the clang work, this project should annotate the runtime to verify those properties as needed.

**Deliverables:** One or more of the above bullet points.

**Mentors:** Bernhard Urban

### Implement https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/System.Runtime.Intrinsics

**Complexity:** Medium



**Mentors:** Miguel de Icaza, Zoltan Varga

### Improve our dynamic checking mode

**Complexity:** Medium

One way we're improving how we test mono is by having a build mode with a lot of extra checks done.

This project would extend it with some number of the following improvements, to be specified in your proposal:

* Integrate the existing offline lock checker tool into checked builds
* Extend the memory management audit points to more places
* Continue the work of verifying memory stores
* Optimize the mm checker
* Add fault injection mode [1]
* Add do-a-lot mode [2]
* Implement other checked modes (TBD)

[1] It's very hard to produce test cases for a lot of failure conditions, so injecting faults instead is a much easier way to test those paths.

[2] Some important, but rarely done, runtime mechanisms are not well tested since they naturally happen very rarely. The idea is to identify a few and have a checked-build mode that triggers then *A LOT*.

**Deliverables**: Implement the dynamic checking mode improvements listed in your proposal.

**Mentors:** Alexander Kyte

### Improve sgen debugging

**Complexity:** Medium

In order to debug issues with our garbage collector, we have a set of functions that we invoke (at runtime or from gdb) in order to check the state of the heap.

We encounter problems with these debugging functions crashing on invalid heap states (we need safe dereferencing of invalid pointers and recovering) or not being fully supported on all configurations.

**Deliverables**: Make debug functions crash safe. Expand support for nursery canaries.

**Mentors:** Vlad Brezae

### JIT optimizations

**Complexity:** Hard

There are a few JIT optimizations that we could profile from:

* type propagation. Right now we perform zero type propagation in the JIT, leading to a lot of missed opportunities.
* delayed/iterated inlining & casting. Allow those to be performed after method-to-ir. This would allow us to do a TON of VERY profitable strength reduction.

**Deliverables**: Implementation of a JIT optimization from the above list, or another of your suggestion. Must pass all unit tests.

**Mentors:** Bernhard Urban

### Make sgen's binary protocol a general purpose runtime tool

**Complexity:** Medium

SGen's binary protocol proved to be an invaluable troubleshooting tool.

It's a flight-recorder kind of tool that should be accessible for all part of the runtime.

This project is to extract it from sgen and make it a general purpose tool for the runtime.

In addition, it should add probes for a few runtime facilities:

* threadpool events
* JIT activity
* ???

A good use case would be to use it to replace the runtime's dtrace probes.

Additionally, improving the tooling around processing binprot files can be part of this project.

**Deliverables**: Extract the binary protocol from sgen and use it to replace the runtime's dtrace probes.

**Mentors:** Ludovic Henry

## Microsoft .NET and Mono integration

Microsoft open sourced large chunks of code the past couple of years:

* ReferenceSource: the source code for the class libraries of .NET as it ships on Windows
* CoreFX: a fresh take on the distribution of the class libraries for a new, slimmer, smaller runtime
* CoreCLR: their C/C++ based runtime, JIT, GC for running on Mac, Linux and Windows
* Roslyn: Microsoft's C# and VB compiler as a service
* CodeContracts: the tools needed to instrument your code

We are tracking various ideas in the [.NET Integration in Mono](https://trello.com/b/vRPTMfdz/net-framework-integration-into-mono) trello board.

### Import reference source System.Web* assemblies

**Complexity:** Medium

Mono has its own implementation of the System.Web assemblies. Microsoft has open-sourced their Reference Source implementation. We would like to replace Mono's existing implementation with Reference Source in order to increase compatibility, and fix bugs and missing features..

**Deliverables**: integrate the Reference Source System.Web.* assemblies into Mono, passing Mono test suite on Windows and Unix.

**Mentors:** Marek Safar

### Import System.IO.FileStream from CoreFX

**Complexity:** Medium

`System.IO.FileStream` is the main class that allow users to read and write to files, pipes and consoles. It's a core component of Mono and the .NET platform. Its quality and reliability is key to a stable and fast development platform.

The goal is to replace our BCL implementation of `System.IO.FileStream` (https://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/mcs/class/corlib/System.IO/FileStream.cs), with the CoreFX one (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/blob/master/src/System.IO.FileSystem/src/System/IO/FileStream.cs). This would allow us to get closer to .NET Core code quality and behaviour.

All changes made to adapt `System.IO.FileStream` to Mono would then be upstreamed to the .NET foundation CoreFx repo (https://github.com/dotnet/corefx)

**Deliverables**: Integrate `FileStream` from CoreFX into Mono and upstream any necessary changes.

**Mentors:** Marek Safar

## Platforms and Bindings

### Implement WebAssembly versions of class library missing bits

**Complexity:** Medium

Our BCL has a lot of pieces that require a new implementation for WebAssembly.

The deliverables of this project is implement WASM specific versions of the following bits:

- System.Threading.Timer
- HttpClient handler
- TimeZone
- Locale

A student proposal should pick a few of those items.

**Deliverables**: Pull requests with implementations of the features specified in your proposal.

**Mentors:** Miguel de Icaza

### Test & fix remaining profile assemblies under WASM

**Complexity:** Medium

Today only mscorlib, System and System.Core have being tested under WebAssembly.

Test the remaining assemblies and fix issues found.

**Deliverables**: pull requests that fix issues found during testing.

**Mentors:** Rodrigo Kumpera

### Urho3d Game Engine Improvements

**Complexity:** Hard

The [UrhoSharp](https://github.com/xamarin/urho) binding makes the [Urho3D](http://urho3d.github.io) game engine accessible from C#, F# and other .NET languages.

Improvements to Urho3D will directly benefit UrhoSharp users. This is an open-ended project idea; you should pick a specific project for your proposal.

Examples of possible projects include:

* [Vulkan](https://www.khronos.org/vulkan) rendering backend
* [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal) rendering backend
* Impostor system
* Procedural texture generation
* Water or sky simulation

NOTE: Contributions must follow the Urho3D contribution rules, and you should confirm with the Urho3D maintainers that they will be willing to merge the feature.

**Deliverables**: Add a feature of your choice to the Urho3D engine, as specified in your proposal.

**Mentors:** Mikayla Hutchinson, Miguel de Icaza
