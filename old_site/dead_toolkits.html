<h1>Dead Toolkits</h1>

<p>The following toolkits are no longer under active development.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id=".28DEAD.29_Sharp_WT">(DEAD) Sharp WT</span></h2>

</p><p>THIS PROJECT IS DEAD. DEVELOPMENT HAS STOPPED BECAUSE OF LACK OF INTEREST.
</p><p>This is a project started by the developers of SharpDevelop.
</p><p>The project started due to the limitations on Windows.Forms and the need to port their large application to Linux. They picked the SWT toolkit which is part of Eclipse and ported it from Java to C#.
</p><p>SWT uses native widgets on each one of its target platforms, so the look and feel matches the underlying operating system.
</p><p>Pros:
</p>
<ul><li> Native look and feel on various platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS).
</li><li> Clean design.
</li><li> The Java version has been successfully used by the Eclipse project. 
</li></ul>
<p>Cons:
</p>
<ul><li> Little or no documentation.
</li><li> Authoring new widgets is either hard (due to testing on multiple platforms), or the look and feel is unique.
</li><li> Still under heavy development.
</li><li> Common denominator subset API problem.
</li></ul>

</p><p>THIS PROJECT IS DEAD. DEVELOPMENT HAS STOPPED BECAUSE OF LACK OF INTEREST.
</p><p>This is a binding to the Qt toolkit. This toolkit used to be under development, but its development has pretty much stopped.
</p><p>Pros:
</p>
<ul><li> Native look and feel on each platform. 
</li></ul>
<p>Cons:
</p>
<ul><li> Toolkit is licensed under the GPL, and the Qt substrate has further licensing limitations. It is not suitable for proprietary or non-GPL development.
</li><li> Binding is unmaintained.
</li><li> Currently its layered on top of the C binding to Qt.
</li></ul>
