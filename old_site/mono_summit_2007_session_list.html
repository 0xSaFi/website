<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Opening_Keynote"> Opening Keynote </span></h2>
<p>Presenter: <b>Miguel de Icaza</b>
</p><p>In this presentation we will discuss the progress since last year and present our roadmap for the next year as well as sharing some interesting stories of Mono.
</p><p>Miguel created the Gnome and Mono projects and currently is in charge of Mono and Moonlight at Novell.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="C_Sharp_3.0_and_LINQ"> C Sharp 3.0 and LINQ </span></h2>
<p>Presenter: <b>Marek Safar</b>
</p><p>C# 3.0 introduces many new and powerful features which target developer 
productivity, and reduce the amount of code necessary to achieve the same 
work. This session will explore each new feature in the context of 
existing conventions as well as the implications of LINQ. If you want to 
start writing Mono enabled C# 3.0 applications you should not miss this 
session.
</p><p>Marek is the main developer for Mono's C# 3.0 compiler at Novell.  Prior to joining Novell he contributed extensively to the C# compiler by providing new features and extensive bug fixing.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Developing_Applications_with_Monodevelop"> Developing Applications with Monodevelop </span></h2>
<p>Presenter: <b>Lluis Sanchez</b>
</p><p>This session will show how to use the MonoDevelop IDE to develop applications with Mono: creating GTK# applications with the integrated visual designer, using custom widget libraries, ASP.NET projects, working with Visual Studio projects, working with Version Control integration, generating tarballs and packages, internationalization, integration with Makefiles, and other interesting features.
</p><p>Lluis Sánchez leads the MonoDevelop project and has turned a community-driven project into one of Mono's most important projects.   Prior to leading this effort he was in charge of Remoting and ASP.NET WebServices in the Mono project.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Birds_of_a_Feather_Sessions"> Birds of a Feather Sessions </span></h2>
<p>A Birds of a Feather session is an informal discussion between a group with similar interests.  If you have an idea for a BoF session you would like to host or attend, please list it on the <a href="http://mono.wik.is/2007_Mono-Meeting/Birds_of_a_Feather_Sessions" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Summit BoF Wiki page</a>.  Time will be set aside on the first and last days of the Mono Summit for BoFs.  You may also schedule after hours BoF sessions.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Towards_A_Virtual_Babel:_Mono_In_Second_Life"> Towards A Virtual Babel: Mono In Second Life </span></h2>
<p>Presenter: <b>Jim Purbrick</b>
</p><p>Second Life is a large, on-line virtual world where avatars dance, fly,
shop, play, meet, work, fall in love... and program. About 256k
residents of Second Life have written 2.5 billion lines of code and run
30 million scripts 24/7 in a continuous 3D landscape twice the size of
Montreal. This giant, collaborative development environment is run on a
grid of over 12k CPUs that simulate the land of Second Life. Integrating
the Mono virtual machine in to this environment has presented a huge set
of challenges but also major advantages and paves the way towards a day
where the Second Life software speaks as many languages as its residents.
</p><p>Dr Jim Purbrick has both academic and industry experience in designing
and building virtual worlds. At Nottingham University he worked on the
MASSIVE-3 virtual environment system and Prix Ars Electronica-winning
mixed-reality games with IGDA award winners, Blast Theory. In industry
Jim designed online games at Codemasters, developed networking and load
balancing technology for Warhammer Online, and is currently working on
scripting and networking technology for Second Life while setting up
Linden Lab Brighton.

<p>Presenter:  <b>Charlie Poole, NUnit Project</b>
</p><p><a href="{{site.baseurl}}/old_site/NUnit" title="NUnit">NUnit</a> is an open source test framework for all languages that run on Mono or .NET. It is one of the most widely used test frameworks for .NET and seems to be the only framework with the stated goal of supporting Mono on an equal footing with .NET. This session will a mix of information about currently available features and those things that are coming in the new NUnit 3.0 platform. Here are some of the highlights I plan to cover...
</p><p>For newbies (brief)
</p>
<ul><li> What unit-testing is about
</li><li> Writing tests with NUnit
</li></ul>
<p>For those who already use NUnit
</p>
<ul><li> Cool stuff in the latest release
</li><li> <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/old_site/NUnitHowTo" title="NUnitHowTo">NUnitHowTo</a> - You tell me what you want covered
</li></ul>
<p>For the intrepid
</p>
<ul><li> Writing Addins for NUnit
</li><li> The next NUnit
</li></ul>
<p>Charlie Poole is the creator of NUnit, the unit testing framework used by Mono and also wildly popular in the .NET world.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mono_on_the_Mac"> Mono on the Mac </span></h2>
<p>Presenter: <b>Geoff Norton</b>
</p><p>A session covering the most common use cases of mono on the mac,  
including but not limited to discussion on the current state of  
System.Windows.Forms, Cocoa#, ObjC# and other Macintosh technologies.
</p><p>Geoff Norton is the author of Cocoa#, ObjC# and the native Windows.Forms driver for the MacOS.   Geoff joined Novell recently and has been in charge of improving Mono's OSX support.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Greengrass"> Greengrass </span></h2>
<p>Presenter: <b>Federico Di Gregorio</b>
</p><p>Greengrass is just another RDF library but with a twist or two. First it
is entirely managed C# code, developed entirely on Mono. Also, it has
the ability to serialize and deserialize RDF resources (OWL instances)
into CLR objects giving the programmer the ability to use high-level
object-oriented programming patterns instead of the classical low-level
triple access. This talk will explain Greengrass internals, how to map
RDF concepts to an object-oriented programming language and will show
how to use the library and the ggtool program to work with an OWL
ontology.

<ul><li>Challenges on Linux with users installing software, and how the build service addresses this problem.  "I have some killer software, but no one is using it because they can't install it!"
</li><li>Example of installing software from the Build Service
</li><li>As needed introduction to rpm based packaging
</li><li>How the build service eases packaging, promotes good practices, and fosters cooperation
</li><li>Getting started and a simple example
</li><li>Q &amp; A
</li></ul>
