<h1>Novell Forge</h1>

<p><br />
Novell Forge (<a href="http://forge.novell.com/" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://forge.novell.com/</a>) is a website managed by Novell to promote the development of open source applications and solutions. Novell Forge features communities, akin to foundries on SourceForge.net, which exist for the purpose of facilitating collaboration and information exchange about certain technologies or solutions. At Miguel's request, we have created a Mono community on Novell Forge that is administered by Miguel. This community, located at <a href="http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/community/?monocomm" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://forge.novell.com/modules/xfmod/community/?monocomm</a>, provides a resource for interaction and collaboration on Mono and associated solutions. Each community has the ability to provide forums, mailing lists, FAQs, news, documentation, surveys, sample code, and links to related applications. The Mono community has been created for anyone interested in Mono to use, and the exact set of features offered at the community is determined by Miguel. 
Any individual or group that wishes to provide Mono-based solutions in an open source fashion is encouraged to host their solution on the Novell Forge website, free of charge. Once the project is hosted on Novell Forge, you can send Miguel an e-mail requesting that your project be associated with the Mono project. This promotes a symbiotic relationship where the growth of Mono applications helps to improve Mono, and the growth of Mono likewise helps to increase the visibility and usefulness of your applications.
