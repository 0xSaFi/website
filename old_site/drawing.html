<h1>Drawing</h1>

<p>Mono provides two mechanism to draw. The first exposes the
Microsoft System.Drawing API and the second exposes the <a href="http://www.cairographics.org" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Cairo</a> API:
</p>
<ul><li> System.Drawing 
</li></ul>

</li></ul>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="System.Drawing"> System.Drawing </span></h2>
<p>The System.Drawing implementation in Mono is designed to be compatible with the Microsoft API. The imaging model is very similar to the PDF 1.4 composition-based imaging model.
</p><p>Our implementation is a C# wrapper around the GDI+ C API (also called the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/gdicpp/GDIPlus/GDIPlusReference.asp" class="external text" rel="nofollow">"GDI+ Flat API"</a>).
This means that the C# code is the same for Windows and UNIX systems. The following graph explains the situation:

<p>In Windows Mono uses the GDI+ library that is included with the operating system (<tt>GDIPLUS.DLL</tt>, while in UNIX we provide an implementation of this API in the <tt>libgdiplus.so</tt> shared library. Our <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/Libgdiplus" title="Libgdiplus">libgdiplus</a> has the same C Flat API as the <tt>GDIPLUS.DLL</tt>. The C# code that implement System.Drawing is the same for Windows and UNIX builds.
Since this is an implementation of an existing Microsoft API no architectural changes go here.
</p><p>Our implementation currently exposes the 1.1 and 2.0 APIs, with a few limitations from the underlying GDI+ implementation.   The details are tracked on the <a href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/libgdiplus/TODO?view=markup" class="external text" rel="nofollow">GDI+ todo page</a>.

<p>Cairo is a low-level 2D vector drawing library. Various rendering backends (XRender, Win32) are already supported and more (ie. glitz -- OpenGL hardware accelerated backend) are on the way. The Mono.Cairo.dll assembly exposes the Cairo API to managed applications. The mapping is a pretty straightforward one, and the programming model is very close to the OpenGL model (although much simpler).
