</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> and i patched StatusBar control to support PanelAdded event, because StatusBarPanel is not added by Controls.Add, StatusBar couldn't navigate it. after i patched winforms and connected the event, statusBar still couldn't navigate children, i dont know what the problem is now
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>

</td></tr>

</td>

<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@mgorse&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> ok
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> I mapped a GroupBox to a Pane class in the automation bridge (which was trivial).  This works except that it doesn't implement IExpandCollapseProvider, so I think that I should check for that before instantiating the Pane
</td>
<td> 07:21
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> I ported one of the cspi test programs to atspi-dbus and added a couple more interfaces to the dbus port of cspi
</td></tr>

</td>
<td> but I've had trouble running/debugging the test program
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> also worked on several bridge bugs
</td>
<td> 07:22
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> and spent a bit more time investigating intercepting keys (tried hooking up a PreviewKeyDown event listener to a Form, but tha tdidn't help).  I mentioned that in the channel last night and filed a bug for it
</td>
<td> 07:23
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@knocte&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> were there any bugs opened against new dbus at-spi? how's sync with the packagers?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@mgorse&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> I committed code in the bridge test to make it use real objects, which makes it work with the new navigation code, tests the code to map providers to adapters, and generally makes it act more like the real world (ie, widgets have a form as their parent)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@knocte&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> yeah I saw that patch for "real" objs, good job
</td>
<td> 07:24
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@mgorse&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> knocte: We don't have a bugzilla or something set up for it yet.  That reminds me that I should talk to Mark and/or Rob about that
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> Next iteration I plan to map NumericUpDownProvider in the bridge
</td>
<td> 07:25
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> and look more at passing keys
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> done
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@knocte&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> yeah, that sounds good, I'll help you on that, but in the meantime, do we already have the "general" component in bugzilla? we could use that
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@mgorse&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> you mean for our project?  There is a general component for it
</td>
<td> 07:26
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@knocte&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> yeah, then let's use that if QA start to try the dbus work
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@sandy&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> knocte, brad: this reminds me, mgorse mentioned that we have all of these pointless versions for our bugzilla products...can we delete them and add "SVN", and then new versions as appropriate?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@knocte&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> ok, thanks mgorse
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@sandy&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> (I have no idea who has admin rights to our bugzilla products)
</td>
<td> 07:27
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@brad&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> sandy: I'd be happy to do that once I get admin rights on bugzilla
</td></tr>

</td>

</td></tr>

</td></tr>

</td>

</td>

</td></tr>
<tr>

</td>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@brad&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@sandy&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> ha, gnome's not a company
</td>
<td> 07:28
</td></tr>
<tr>

</td>
<td> fair
</td></tr>
<tr>

</td></tr>

</td>

</td></tr>

</td>
<td> knocte should be able to get it as a pm
</td></tr>
<tr>

</td>

</td>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@bgmerrell&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>

</td></tr>

</td>
<td> i don't think he can give you rights, though
</td>
<td> 07:30
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@knocte&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>

</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> bgmerrell: fine thanks for the info; ok,so let's switch to QA now
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> and, btw, bgmerrell, your turn&#160;:)
</td>
<td> 07:31
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> BTW, could you move the test we talked earlier (from mario) to your test suite?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> can it be moved without translating it to py code? just leaving it as is?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> (  <a href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/t" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/source/t</a> runk/uia2atk/src/UiaAtkBridge/UiaAtkBrid geTest/Bug416602.cs  )
</td>
<td> 07:32
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@bgmerrell&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> what test?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> shouldn't we be running unit tests when we build?
</td>
<td> 07:33
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@knocte&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> he's more a regression test than a unit test I believe, unless brad gives us another idea, well just add that to your plan for next iteration...
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> yes, why?
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> s/he's/it's/
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@brad&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> well, we definitely need to establish some sort of unit/regression/whatever suite
</td>
<td> 07:34
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@knocte&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> ok maybe we should talk about this after the iteration&#160;:) you can start with your summary
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@bgmerrell&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> okay, here i go
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@brad&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> and running that at build time, if not too time intensitve, is a good idea
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@bgmerrell&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> I actually have working orca tests against gtk samples now, yipee!  this is mostly what i worked on during this iteration.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> i also worked on fixing a crashing problem with our winforms tests.  evidently, our code and/or WinForms takes a little longer than Gtk for the application to launch and applications list to settle; this was causing the crashes.
</td>
<td> 07:35
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@knocte&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> ok
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@bgmerrell&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> i did spend some time preparing for utosc, but tried to to do most of that over the weekend
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> next iteration i need to come up with a good plan to test using orca.. i haven't decide what the best way to approach this will be...
</td>
<td> 07:36
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> because it's a lot more complicated to know exactly what Orca should read
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> i've thought about maybe writing an app in Gtk and WinForms and making them as similar as possible and making sure that Orca reads them about the same..
</td>
<td> 07:37
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> but that's just an idea
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> so any ideas are welcome&#160;:)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> and like sandy said, utosc stuff
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> done
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@knocte&gt;&#160;</b>
</td>
<td> ok I guess brad and/or mgorse will have good ideas for the orca testing as well!
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> thanks bgmerrell
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> we'll talk now with calen
</td>
<td> 07:38
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> <b>&lt;@bgmerrell&gt;&#160;</b>

</td>
<td> 07:39
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> but I should mention when running GroupBox test that after bug411882 is been fixed we can't use 'button.click' do the action (but need change to 'button._doAction('click')). another problem is when the test do click action, we should move the mouse through the application window otherwise the label can't get the new info just like bug415320.
