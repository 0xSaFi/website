<h1>Running your first Mono application</h1>

<p>The normal way to run an application you have compiled with Mono would be to invoke it through the Mono runtime, like this:
</p>
<pre>
 mono myprogram.exe </pre>
<p>However, there are two things you can do to make it more convenient to run Mono applications on Linux. The first is to use a shell script instead of the EXE file. For example, if you had "myprogram.exe" you could create a shell script called "myprogram" that had the contents:
</p>
<pre>
 #!/bin/sh /usr/bin/mono /usr/bin/myprogram.exe &quot;$@&quot; </pre>
<p>When you run "myprogram," the shell will replace $@ with any arguments you provided.
</p><p>If you installed mono to a different location, substitute that for /usr/bin/mono. You can check with the "which mono" command.
</p><p>Debian GNU/Linux systems also ship with the ability to launch Mono or WINE directly as appropriate when exe files are executed.
</p><p>On other systems, this can be achieved manually using BINFMT_MISC to register the exe files as non-native binaries. Then, when trying to launch an exe file, the kernel will invoke the mono runtime to handle the command. BINFMT_MISC can also be used to launch Windows executables using WINE, or Java .class files using a JVM. To register exe with the kernel:
</p>
<ul><li> Become root and turn on the BINFMT_MISC module in your kernel with this command:
</li></ul>
<pre>
 modprobe binfmt_misc
</pre>
<p>In addition, you may want to add that command to your /etc/rc.local boot script, so that it will be executed on boot.
</p>
<ul><li> Add the line below to your /etc/fstab file:
</li></ul>
<pre>
 binfmt_misc /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc binfmt_misc none 
</pre>
<ul><li> Then, have your system run the following command on boot:
</li></ul>
<pre>
 echo ':CLR:M::MZ::/usr/bin/mono:' &gt; /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register 
</pre>
<ul><li> Be sure to mark your .exe files as executable in the filesystem as well:
</li></ul>
<pre>
 chmod +x myprogram.exe 
</pre>
