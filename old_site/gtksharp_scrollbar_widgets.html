<h1>GtkSharp: Scrollbar Widgets</h1>

<p>[http:/monodoc/T:Gtk.Range Range] widgets are your standard, run-of-the-mill scrollbars. These should be used only for scrolling some other widget, such as a list, a text box, or a viewport (and it's generally easier to use the scrolled window widget in most cases). For other purposes, you should use scale widgets, as they are friendlier and more featureful. 
</p><p>There are separate types for horizontal and vertical scrollbars. There really isn't much to say about these. You create them with the following functions: 
</p>
<pre class="csharp" style="font-family:monospace;">HScrollbar hscrollbar1 <span style="color: #008000;">=</span> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=new+msdn.microsoft.com"><span style="color: #008000;">new</span></a> HScrollbar<span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span> adjustment <span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #008000;">;</span>
VScrollbar vscrollbar1 <span style="color: #008000;">=</span> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=new+msdn.microsoft.com"><span style="color: #008000;">new</span></a> VScrollbar<span style="color: #008000;">&#40;</span> adjustment <span style="color: #008000;">&#41;</span><span style="color: #008000;">;</span></pre>
<p>and that's about it. The adjustment argument can either be a pointer to an existing Adjustment, or NULL, in which case one will be created for you. Specifying <tt>null</tt> might actually be useful in this case, if you wish to pass the newly-created adjustment to the constructor function of some other widget which will configure it for you, such as a text widget.
