<p>The Mono runtime can be embedded into an existing C, C++ or Objective-C based application. Embedding allows developers to keep their existing investment on their current code base while extending its functionality with CIL-based components. This is a key concept: to take advantage of Mono, you do not need to rewrite your software from scratch: you can keep everything you have today, and write new code in Mono, and have both universes communicate with each other. 
</p><p>Embedding is also known as "hosting" to developers coming from the .NET Framework. 
</p><p>Embedding is particularly useful when you have an existing application, but you would like to extend its functionality either by reusing third-party Mono, .NET components or Java components, or enable developers to "script" components of your application with any of the .NET or Java supported languages. 
</p><p>The embedding API of Mono requires some little knowledge about C and C#. You might not need to read this entire document, it depends very much on the needs of your application. 
</p><p>(P/Invoke allows Mono developers to call from the managed world APIs that are exposed by the C universe and provides various automatic marshalling mechanisms to convert information back and forth between the managed world and the unmanaged world.  For more details on the P/Invoke platform, you are encouraged to read the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/old_site/Interop_with_Native_Libraries" title="Interop with Native Libraries">Interop_with_Native_Libraries</a>.)
