<p>At this point, no group in the Mono project has plans to implement Windows Presentation Foundation APIs as part of the project.   
</p><p>We do not have any plans because the project is too large and there has not been any serious interest from the community to make this effort move forward.
</p><p>Some bits have been implemented for WindowsBase and they are distributed with Mono (mostly because System.IO.Packaging is part of WindowsBase).    Various classes and stubs were developed and live in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Olive" title="Olive">Olive</a> module.
</p><p>Anyone interested in contributing should follow the guidelines in the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Contributing" title="Contributing">Contributing</a> page and post their patches to the <a href="/index.php?title=Lists&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Lists (page does not exist)">mono-devel-list@lists.ximian.com mailing list</a>
</p><p>At this point, we strongly suggest that users interested in WPF adopt Silverlight instead as it can now be used outside of the browser and offers a rich set of cross platform APIs and features.

<p>Silverlight implement a subset of the WPF APIs and is available on Windows, MacOS X and through our own open source effort <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Moonlight" title="Moonlight">Moonlight</a> it is available on Linux and other Unix systems.
</p><p>Silverlight does not have all the capabilities of WPF, but both technologies are converging API-wise.
</p><p>Silverlight can now be used outside of the browser, and Moonlight can be configured to be used with the full .NET API outside of the browser.
