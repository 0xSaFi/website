<h1>Mono:IA64</h1>

<p>The IA64 port is at the same level as the x86/amd64 ports. Currently, only linux is supported.
</p><p>The port was started by Zoltan Varga in May 2005 and completed in August of the same year.

<p>In addition to the usual mono dependencies, it depends on the libunwind package to implement exception handling:
</p><p><a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/libunwind/" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.hpl.hp.com/research/linux/libunwind/</a>
</p><p>By default, the mono GC is configured to use 8KB pages, which will not work on
IA64 machines with a 4KB page size. To check the page size on your system,
type:
</p><p>zcat /proc/config.gz | grep PAGE_SIZE_4KB
</p><p>If this prints something like this:
</p><p>CONFIG_IA64_PAGE_SIZE_4KB=y
</p><p>then mono needs to be compiled with a compiler flag to use 4KB pages:
</p><p>configure "CFLAGS=-DHBLKSIZE=4096"
</p><p>A runtime compiled this way will work on machines using both 4KB and 8KB pages.
