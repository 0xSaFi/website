<h1>Mono:Versioning</h1>

<p>Mono's version numbering policy follows the Gnome and the Linux Kernel versioning policies.  Mono <i>does not</i> follow or mimic .NET versioning in any way.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mono.27s_Version_Policy_Explained"> Mono's Version Policy Explained </span></h2>
<p>For an X.Y.Z tuple:
</p>
<ul><li> <i>X</i> is the major version mumber
</li><li> <i>Y</i> is the minor version number
</li><li> <i>Z</i> is a revision number
</li></ul>
<p>The major version number is used to indicate which ABI/API version Mono uses.  When it changes, there is <i>no gaurantee</i> that existing code will continue to work (though the utmost effort will be made to maintain compatibility).  The major version changes infrequently.
</p><p>The Minor version number consists of two sets: even numbers (stable releases) and odd numbers (development releases).  The only improvements that stable releases receive are bug fixes; all new feature work is done in development releases.  Features <i>may</i> be backported from a development release to a stable release, if appropriate.  Stable releases are API and ABI stable, and can be expected to have minimal changes.
</p><p>Development releases <i>may</i> break ABI/API compatibility, especially if the stable release they lead up to will change the Major version number.  In particular, development releases are likely to add new API, and the use of new API can change between development releases.  When a development release is converted into a stable release, we will maintain the API/ABI, and the new stable release should be fully compatible with the previous stable series having the same major number.
</p><p>Revision numbers signify the release of a Major/Minor pair.  Within a stable series, ABI/API compatibility should not be broken when the revision changes.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Examples"> Examples </span></h3>
<p>Mono 1.0.6 is the 7th stable release of the 1.0 series (version 1.0.0 ... 1.0.6 is 7 releases).
</p><p>Mono 1.1.6 is the 7th development release of the 1.1 development series.  When finished, it will result in the Mono 1.2 stable series.    Mono 1.1.x is the current development tree.  Mono 1.2 will be backward compatible with Mono 1.0 (old apps should continue to run), but will not be forward compatible with 1.0 (apps using 1.2-specific functionality won't work under 1.0).
</p><p>After Mono 1.2 is released, a Mono 1.3 development branch will be started.  The 1.3.x series will lead up to the future Mono 2.0 release.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id=".NET_Versioning"> .NET Versioning </span></h2>
<p>Microsoft .NET's version policy is similar to Mono's, in that a major version number change indicates an API/ABI break.  That's where the simularities stop.  .NET does not have a stable/development split; .NET 1.0 and 1.1 were both stable releases.
</p><p>Furthermore, there is no mapping between Mono's version numbers and .NET's version numbers.  Mono 1.0 implemented <i>parts</i> of the .NET 1.0/1.1 API; in particular, it lacked System.Windows.Forms support.  Mono 1.1 (the current <i>development</i> branch) also implements parts of the .NET 1.0/1.1 API; in particular, it will support System.Windows.Forms.  Mono 1.1 also implements parts of the .NET 2.0 API. Other parts of the .NET API are not implemented at all, such as System.EnterpriseServices.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Framework_Versioning"> Framework Versioning </span></h2>
<p>For compatibility reasons, Mono's [http:/monodoc/P:System.Environment.Version System.Environment.Version] property returns the version of the .NET profile that Mono targets, <i>not</i> the version of Mono that is being used.  This should be the same version number that .NET would return.  As such, it will return 2.0.X.Y when running under the 2.0 profile, even though it's running under Mono 1.1.&#160;:-)
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Application_Versioning"> Application Versioning </span></h2>
<p>`mono --version` and `mcs --version` return the version of the Mono
distribution.

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="If_I_use_mcs_to_compile_a_simple_program_and_then_use_mono_to_run_it.2C_which_version_of_the_assemblies_will_it_use_.28e.g._which_System.Windows.Forms.dll.29_.3F"> If I use mcs to compile a simple program and then use mono to run it, which version of the assemblies will it use (e.g. which System.Windows.Forms.dll)&#160;? </span></h4>
<p>It will use the version that is sym-linked in <i>preflix</i>/lib/mono/1.0/System.Windows.Forms.dll, which will be the 1.0 version of System.Windows.Forms.dll.
</p><p>If you used gmcs instead, you'd get the 2.0 version of System.Windows.Forms.dll, since gmcs targets the 2.0 profile.

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="If_I_use_svn_update_to_get_the_latest_code_and_then_run_make_and_make_install_in_the_mono_directory_how_does_it_decide_which_version_it_is_making_and_where_to_place_the_assembly.3F"> If I use svn update to get the latest code and then run make and make install in the mono directory how does it decide which version it is making and where to place the assembly? </span></h4>
<p>Mono will <b>always</b> place a copy into the $prefix/lib/mono/gac/ASSEMBLY/1.0.5000... directory.  So you'll overwrite the previous version of System.dll et. al.
</p><p>If you configured your mono checkout with --with-preview=yes, make install will <b>also</b> place a copy into $prefix/lib/mono/gac/ASSEMBLY/2.0.3600..., overwriting whatever file was previously there.
</p><p>In other words, you can only ever have two versions of any Mono assemblies, both of which will be overwritten by Mono during make
install.  Which means that Mono isn't parallel-installable with itself (you have to choose a different prefix if you want a different version of Mono).
</p><p>(Note that the 1.0 library and the 2.0 library will differ; during `make` these libraries are built once for each profile, setting various #defines for each profile.  The versioned assemblies are placed into mcs/class/lib/PROFILE, and it's the PROFILE/ASSEMBLY file which is placed into $prefix/lib/mono/gac/ASSEMBLY/VERSION...)
</p><p>Why is this the case?  Because Mono doesn't choose the version number for those assemblies, Microsoft does, and for compatibility we need to choose the same version numbers so that when Mono compiles a program .NET will be able to load the correct assemblies when running under .NET. Compatibility trumps all.
