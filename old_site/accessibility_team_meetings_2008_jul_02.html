</td>

</td>
<td> Pending things that I'll try to do in next iteration (in the free time I may have at Guadecs) is:
</td>
<td> 07:26
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> - To catch up with calvin about the parent/child problem (issue about using Simple/Fragment/FragmentRoot providers) because I've looked a bit into it and have some doubts (I guess we can figure this out better whenever we start to launch more structureChanged events because AFAIK we only launch them currently for the window(form) creation)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> - To finish figuring out the best way to test events, and thus incorporate some in the unit tests (we will have to transform them in normal unit tests that don't do the at-spi roundtrip whenever we can test them properly)
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
</td>
<td> - Debug a problem we have with the bridge tests as MD seems to lock and eat the memory (maybe I'm facing a Mono SVN unstability issue..., I've just experimented this, didn't have time to look into it) when I was going to test the new navigation support of ComboBoxProvider (thanks to MarioC!)
