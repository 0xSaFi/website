<h1>Accessibility: Build Bot Commands</h1>

<p>Our friendly continuous integration system, Hudson, mirrors the mono, mcs, and gtk-sharp trees every hour looking for new code to build.  However, if a commit is made to one of these projects that is required by code about to be committed to uia2atk, and Hudson hasn't had a chance to mirror the latest changes, the build will break.  To avoid this situation, you can ask Hudson to rebuild individual modules on demand.
</p><p>If a rebuild is required in mono or mcs:
</p>
<pre>!hudson build mono-core_trunk_tarball
</pre>
<p>If a rebuild is required in gtk-sharp:
</p>
<pre>!hudson build gtk-sharp212_branch_tarball
</pre>
<p>The latest targets for the build command are available on <a href="http://build0.sled.lab.novell.com:8010/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Hudson's web interface</a>.
