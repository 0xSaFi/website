<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="It.27s_a_wiki.21">It's a wiki!</span></h2>
	<p>Been a little time since I've played with a wiki. Thought I'd use this page to experiment</p>	 
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tom_McLaughlin">Tom McLaughlin</span></h2>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Who_am_I.3F">Who am I?</span></h3>
<p><a href="{{site.github.url}}/images/old_site/0/0e/Tml.png" class="image" title="Description"><img alt="Description" src="{{site.github.url}}/images/old_site/0/0e/Tml.png" width="48" height="48" /></a> I'm Tom... Okay, maybe a little more than that is in order. I live outside Boston in Needham, Massachussetts. I have lived here for 2 and a half years and still do not know how to spell the name of the state I live in. The area I live in also seems to be Mono central since Ximian's office is near me. I work in Norwood at <a href="http://www.meditech.com" class="external text" rel="nofollow">MEDITECH Inc.</a> as an Application Specialist support specialist. There I support our electronic claims software for hospital &lt;-&gt; insurance payor electronic claim EDI transaction communication. Uhhh, yeah... It really is as boring as it sounds. Basically I do customer support where I 1.) stare in amazement at some people 2.) watch as customers ignore me and wonder why things still don't work and 3.) contemplate what purgatory really is. (I'm a really nice guy, just not a "people person".) I transfer to Corporate Technology (IT) in a few months to be a junior admin. I'm psyched.</p>	 
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="FreeBSD.2C_Mono.2C_and_Me">FreeBSD, Mono, and Me</span></h3>
<p>Some obligatory bits about myself and Mono. I'm the FreeBSD port maintainer for Mono and the related apps. I am FreeBSD's third Mono victi^W maintainer. The port was initially mintained by the <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/gnome" class="external text" rel="nofollow">FreeBSD Gnome Team</a> but dropped by them. The second port maintainer, John Merryweather Cooper, ran off to a remote area of Idaho where he could not be found after a few months. Since about August I've had the job.</p>	 
<p><br />	 
Let me list my qualifications:	 
</p>
<ul><li> I am a novice programmer, if you could even call me that.	 
</li><li> I have no C# experience... no C experience... and no OOP experience.<br />(Heck, I have no experience with a language other than Bourne script.)	 
</li><li> I have a lot of time on my hands.	 
</li></ul>
<p><br />	 
</p>
<p><i>"There any many people more qualified than me for this job, but I'm the one that showed up." -Me </i></p>	 
<p>That quote basically explains how I became FreeBSD's Mono maintainer. One night I thought to myself, "Gee, I should really learn a programming language. That's a good idea." Liking Muine and knowing that Mono was maintainerless, I figured C# would be a good choice in spite of various FreeBSD specific issues. Like I said, I just showed up and got the job.&#160;:) Anyways, right now my Mono time is spent keeping the various ports up to date, trying to figure out what is causing Mono's FreeBSD crashes in our libpthread, attempting to cajole a FreeBSD developer into looking at our problems, and oh... Trying to learn C# when I have the time.</p>	 
<p>That's about it right now. Hopefully there will be more on this page in the future but I have ports to play with and need to add a BSD page to the site.</p>
