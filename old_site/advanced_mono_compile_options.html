<h1>Advanced Mono Compile Options</h1>

<p>It is possible to tune your Mono configuration to your particular needs by using configure-time options. 
</p><p>A complete list of options are shown if you run the configure script with the --help option, but here we describe some important elements.
</p><p>These are configuration options that the Mono team does provide support for.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Xen_Support"> Xen Support </span></h3>
<p>If you are planning on running Mono on Xen instances, you should use the --with-xen_opt=yes flag.
</p><p>This will make Mono use a Xen-friendly set of TLS operations.
</p><p>This is a supported configuration option.
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="Prefix"> Prefix </span></h3>
<p>There are a number of options that control where Mono will install its files.
</p><p>Usually Mono is rooted on a "prefix", and binaries, libraries, data files, manual pages are then based from this prefix.   To customize the prefix, you pass the --prefix command line option to configure.
