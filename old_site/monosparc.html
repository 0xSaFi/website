<h1>Mono:SPARC</h1>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Platforms_Supported"> Platforms Supported </span></h2>
<p>Currently, only the 32 bit SPARCv8 ABI is supported (32 bit userspace).
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Operating_Systems_Supported"> Operating Systems Supported </span></h2>
<p>At this point, only the Solaris operating system is supported.  
</p><p>Mono releases from 1.1.14 onward should run on Linux/SPARC as well.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Building_Mono_on_Solaris"> Building Mono on Solaris </span></h2>
<p>To build Mono on Solaris you will need a complete GNU toolchain:
</p>
<ul><li> Use GNU tar to unpack the sources, as Solaris tar has problems unpacking Mono.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> Do not use any of the Solaris tools for the build (cc, ld, as, m4, yacc, sed), make sure that you have a set of GNU tools.  When running configure, make sure that none of the build tools used are from Solaris.  Set CC=gcc and use gmake for the build.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> You might need to add /usr/ccs/bin to your PATH since it contains the 'ar' utility needed during the build.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> /usr/ccs/bin contains an 'mcs' command which has the same name as our C# compiler. This will confuse the build process, so either rename it to something else, or copy the 'ar' command to another directory and include that directory in your path instead of /usr/ccs/bin.
</li></ul>
<ul><li> If during compilation, gcc reports errors in system header files, you might need to to patch the header files to be compatible with gcc. To do this, run (as root);
</li></ul>
