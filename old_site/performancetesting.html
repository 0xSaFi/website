<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Runtime"> Runtime </span></h1>
<p>Tomas Kalibera from Charles University in Prague has a project that tracks the performance of the Mono runtime, see his project page <a href="http://nenya.ms.mff.cuni.cz/projects/mono/index.phtml" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
</p><p>Their Mono Performance testing project tracks performance improvements and regressions on a number of tests and tracks the corresponding changes in the Mono source code that caused the change.
</p><p>Any tests that are part of the mono/tests also become performance tests, the status can be tracked in the following page 24 hours after they are commited:
