</div>
<p>This page lists some ideas for Mono GSoC projects that students can apply for.  Additionally, we encourage students to submit their own interesting Mono-related project proposals.  In past years, roughly 20% of the accepted proposals were original ideas from students instead of from our suggestions.  You can submit more than one proposal, so you can submit your own ideas as well as apply for one from this list - but only one can be chosen, of course!

<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Compilers_and_Tools"> Compilers and Tools </span></h1>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="C.23_Compiler_switch_statement_enhancements"> C# Compiler switch statement enhancements </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Medium
</p><p><b>Area:</b> C#
</p><p>Implement perfect hashing and other optimizations for C# switch statement. The task is to come up with a heuristic backed up by some benchmarks for each implementation and implement it.
</p><p><b>Deliverable:</b> A set of patches which generally improve switch statement performance including tests for any special cases.
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Marek Safar, Miguel de Icaza
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="MonoDevelop_.2F_Xamarin_Studio_IDE"> MonoDevelop / Xamarin Studio IDE </span></h1>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Make_ASP.NET_Awesome_in_Xamarin_Studio"> Make ASP.NET Awesome in Xamarin Studio </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Easy
</p><p><b>Area:</b> C#, ASP.NET
</p><p>Xamarin Studio ASP.NET support is still maintained but has not been very actively developed in some time. There's lots of room for polishing and updating it and adding minor but useful features - for example, ASP.NET MVC4+5 templates, support for VS2013 projects, deploying to remote servers, being able to choose which web browser to launch when running/debugging, C# tooltips and navigation in Razor files, etc. There's a lot of flexibility which features you want to work on, you can choose from the above examples and/or propose your own.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> Polish ASP.NET addin, implement some number of minor features.
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Michael Hutchinson
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Source_Analysis_and_Refactoring"> Source Analysis and Refactoring </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Medium
</p><p><b>Area:</b> Parsers, C#
</p><p>The IDE supports source analysis using NRefactory to analyze source code, indicate potential problems or improvements to the user as "code issues", and perform "code actions" and "quick fixes" to transform code automatically. There are almost unlimited possibilities what can be done to analyze or restructure source code. The system is very flexible, and we already support a large number of actions and code analysis rules. But there's plenty of room to add more to help people write good code. If you like source code analysis or refactoring, it's a great chance to work in this area. You should look at other similar tools and the existing rules in MonoDevelop, and propose a set of new and useful code actions and/or code issues.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> Useful code actions, code issues, and/or refactorings.
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Michael Hutchinson, Mike Krüger
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Javascript_Support"> Javascript Support </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Hard
</p><p><b>Area:</b> C#, Javascript
</p><p>Full Javascript support would be very useful for developers writing web apps and embedding HTML pages in desktop and mobile apps. This includes code completion, code folding, syntax highlighting, document outline, etc. It should work in standalone JS files and inline in HTML, CSHTML and ASPX files. The code completion should be capable of handling common JS frameworks such as JQuery. There are several open-source managed JS/AS parsers that could perhaps be used.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> JS editing support in standalone files and inline in HTML/CSHTML files.
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Michael Hutchinson
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="TypeScript_Support"> TypeScript Support </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Medium
</p><p><b>Area:</b> C#, Javascript
</p><p>Bring to Xamarin Studio support for the TypeScript language, similar to what the SharpDevelop team did:
</p><p><a href="http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2013/04/24/TypeScriptSupportInSharpDevelop.aspx" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://community.sharpdevelop.net/blogs/mattward/archive/2013/04/24/TypeScriptSupportInSharpDevelop.aspx</a>
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> Ported version of the SharpDevelop adding, featuring: TypeScript compilation on save or build, Code completion, Find references, Rename refactoring, Typescript syntax hightlighting
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Miguel de Icaza, (Matt Ward, Michael Hutchinson, Atsushi Eno)
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Improve_C.2FC.2B.2B_Binding"> Improve C/C++ Binding </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Hard
</p><p><b>Area:</b> C#, C, C++
</p><p>The C/C++ binding is an under-maintained area of Xamarin Studio. The first part of this project would be to generally polish it and fix bugs, perhaps adding support for the clang and mingw32 compilers. The second part would be to replace the ctags based code completion with libclang, and generally improve code completion and code navigation.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> Negotiable, but should substantially improve C/C++ code completion.
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Michael Hutchinson, Jeffrey Stedfast
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Improve_C.2FC.2B.2B_build_support_in_XBuild"> Improve C/C++ build support in XBuild </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Medium
</p><p><b>Area:</b> C#, C, C++
</p><p>The C/C++ build support in xbuild was much improved in GSoC 2011 but still needs some work to better integrate other compilers than MSVC. The first part of this project would be to generally polish it and fix bugs, and add support for the Clang and GCC compilers. This involves adding a mapping from the VS-compatible parameters to the respective command line options on those compilers. The second part would be to improve the C++ binding in MonoDevelop (see entry above) to use this and be able to compile and load and save MSBuild C++ projects from the IDE in Windows and OSX/Linux. This is important as MonoDevelop is migrating to MSBuild, and the C/C++ project type will be dropped unless it is ported to MSBuild.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> Negotiable, but should substantially improve C/C++ build support.
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Michael Hutchinson, Atsushi Eno
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Windows_.NET_64-bit_debugging"> Windows .NET 64-bit debugging </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Medium/Hard
</p><p><b>Area:</b> C#, Win32, Debugging
</p><p>Add support for 64-bit app to the MS .NET debugger runtime on Windows.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> Reliable debugging for the 64-bit MS .NET runtime .
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Michael Hutchinson, Marius Ungureanu
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Debugger_Visualizers"> Debugger Visualizers </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Easy
</p><p><b>Area:</b> C#, Debugging
</p><p>There is plenty of room to improve the debugging experience with visualizer pop-ups that provide more useful ways to inspect common kinds of data - for example, collection visualizers that allow searching for items in the collection, XML/JSON visualizers that provide a structured, searchable tree view of the document, and so-on. Your proposal should include a list of visualizers that you propose to implement, and describe why they are useful.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> A set of useful debugger visualizers.
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Michael Hutchinson, Jeffrey Stedfast
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Revamped_Syntax_Highlighting_System"> Revamped Syntax Highlighting System </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Medium/Hard
</p><p><b>Area:</b> Parsers, Text Editor
</p><p>The syntax highlighting in MonoDevelop is done by defining a grammar as xml file to colorize tokens. Some highlightings are extended with hand written code. The highlighting system can be made faster (maybe with an on the fly compiler approach), more extensible (atm it's difficult to write semantic highlightings) and more scaleable . You will first need to understand how our highlighting files are defined and how the semantic highlighting currently works. After that a new implementation approach needs to be implemented. One of our current drawbacks are that regular expressions could be integrated better - for example span begin/end constructs aren't atm regular. In fact everything should be based on regular expressions.  Esp. important is to have a system that allows to plug in semantic highlightings and highlightings should be embeddable. (Semantic highlighting works inside of asp.net files for example)
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> An extensible syntax highlighting system that reads our xml files or a similar format. It should be scalable even for large files (lazy analysis) and much faster than the current implementation (speed tests included).
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Mike Krüger
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Color_Scheme_Editor"> Color Scheme Editor </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Easy/Medium
</p><p><b>Area:</b> Text Editor
</p><p>The current color style editor is hard to use and is missing some features. It would be nice to have a color style editor that works like <a href="http://studiostyl.es/schemes/create" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://studiostyl.es/schemes/create</a>. Furthermore it would be nice to have an editor mode where you can just adjust some colors and other colors are chosen using an algorithm providing good contrasts. The implementation should be done using xwt - a great cross platform development library.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> an awesome color scheme editor
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Mike Krüger
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Xwt_Forms_Designer"> Xwt Forms Designer </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Medium
</p><p><b>Area:</b> Xwt
</p><p>Xwt is a cross platform GUI toolkit. It works on Windows, Mac and Linux using the native GUI widgets like SWT for Java does. The biggest drawback at the moment is the lack of a working forms designer. The forms designer should be implemented as a Xamarin Studio plugin allowing designing Xwt dialogs and controls like the current gtk forms designer does.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> A Xwt forms designer
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Mike Krüger
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="GitHub_Integration"> GitHub Integration </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Medium/Hard
</p><p><b>Area:</b> C#
</p><p>Xamarin Studio's Git support could use improvements by using Octokit.NET to integrate with GitHub. Integrating features in the IDE which interact with GitHub would make workflow much better. The proposal should include a list of features that you think are good to have in Xamarin Studio and why you would add them.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> Negotiable, but at least basic integration with GitHub such as checkout from user repositories, publishing to a new github repository, opening a pull request and submitting gists.
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Marius Ungureanu

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Push-less_X86_backend"> Push-less X86 backend </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Medium
</p><p><b>Area:</b> Runtime
</p><p>The x86 backend uses push/pop instructions. This produced code that is less efficient and harder to be dealt with internally.
</p><p><b>Deliverables:</b> A x86 backend that uses fixed size frames and mov instead.
</p><p><b>Mentors:</b> Rodrigo Kumpera, Zoltan Varga

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Use_IKVM.Reflection_to_implement_parts_of_System.Reflection.Emit"> Use IKVM.Reflection to implement parts of System.Reflection.Emit </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity</b>: Medium

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Bindinator:_Create_bindings_for_clutter.2Fgst-clutter.2C_improve_gst"> Bindinator: Create bindings for clutter/gst-clutter, improve gst </span></h2>
<p><b>Complexity:</b> Medium
</p><p><b>Area:</b> C#, C, Glib, GTK, XML
</p><p>There is an ongoing effort to automate the generation of C# bindings on the GNOME desktop by leveraging the new GObject introspection data that is now available for most libraries. GObject introspection data includes xml files and typeobject files (binary) describing the APIs a library exposes. The bindinator project (<a href="https://github.com/andreiagaita/bindinator" class="external free" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/andreiagaita/bindinator</a>) takes this information and produces gapi files that can then be used with GTK# gapi tools for generating C# bindings.
</p><p>The tasks are:
</p><p>- Create bindings for cluttergtk and gst-clutter
</p><p>- Update gstreamer to v1.4, which will be released in May
</p><p>- Continue the bindinator work by fixing and improving the tool
