<h1>ASP.NET and mod mono</h1>

<p>Using Mono, you can build ASP web applications using Linux or Windows without losing the flexibility and power of Apache. Mono's ASP.NET implementation has two major components:
</p>
<ul><li>XSP is a simple, standalone webserver written in C# that hosts ASP.NET's System.Web classes.
</li></ul>
<ul><li><a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/Mod_mono" title="Mod mono">mod_mono</a> is an Apache 1.3/2.0/2.2 module that integrates Mono's ASP.NET support with the Apache HTTP server.
</li></ul>
<p>These tools allow you to build an infrastructure for web applications (code for which the primary interface is pointing and clicking on a webpage) and for <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/Web_Services" title="Web Services">web services</a> (SOAP-based RPC systems). They work with many publicly-available .NET applications, and the underlying web services stack is used in several commercial applications. 
</p><p>If you want to write your own webserver, the class libraries will support this, though that is an advanced topic out of the scope of this document. 
</p><p>For more information, see <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/ASP.NET" title="ASP.NET">ASP.NET</a>.
