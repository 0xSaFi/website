<h1>MONO IOMAP</h1>

<p>Introduced in Mono 1.2, MONO_IOMAP allows Mono to ignore certain types of file IO errors caused by applications not properly coded to deal with differences between Windows file systems and Linux file systems.
</p><p>The types of issues MONO_IOMAP fixes are:
</p>
<ul><li> Linux file systems are case sensitive, Windows is not.
</li><li> Linux uses '/' as the path separator, Windows uses '\'.
</li><li> Windows paths begin with a drive letter, Linux paths do not.
</li></ul>
<p>The options that can be passed to MONO_IOMAP are:
</p>
<ul><li> case: makes all file system access case insensitive.
</li><li> drive: strips drive name from pathnames.
</li><li> all: enables both case and drive. 
</li></ul>
<p>All options will trigger the directory separator mapping.
</p><p>To run your application:
</p>
<pre>
$ export MONO_IOMAP=all
$ mono myapp.exe
</pre>
<p>For ASP.NET applications hosted with mod_mono, you can add the following directive to your Apache configuration file:
</p>
<pre>
MonoSetEnv MONO_IOMAP=all
</pre>
<br /><div style="margin-left: auto; padding: 5px; margin-right: auto; background-color: #C6D8ED; border: 1px solid #5084C5; border-left-width: 10px; margin-top: 7px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
Note: MONO_IOMAP is a shortcut to help port your application to Mono.  However, there is a performance hit that comes with using it.  For the long term, it is recommended that you change your application to be cross platform compatible without MONO_IOMAP.
