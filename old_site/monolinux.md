Mono:Linux
==========

Mono is primarily developed on Linux, and most of its users are Linux users, so it is the platform best supported.

Packages for various distributions are available on our [Downloads]({{site.github.url}}/old_site/Downloads "Downloads") page.

Mono on Linux supports a number of Linux-specific optimizations.
