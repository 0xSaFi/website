Hacking Mono for fame and glory
===============================

Without the help, the skills and the time of many passionate developers outside of the Ximian Mono team, Mono would not be where it is today.

Many of them do it for fun, some do it because they really want a nice CLR they can hack on, some do it because they need a working solution to some development issues and mono is the ideal tool for the job.

Some of them may start contributing because they want a mention in the Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame! Whatever the cause, join us in a big **Thank you**!

Mono Hacker's Hall of Fame
==========================

John Luke
---------

John Luke has touched many aspects of Mono, including the core libraries, Gtk\#, MonoDevelop, and Monodoc. His skills are apparent from his work. He sets an example by writing documentation along with his patches.

Dan Morgan
----------

Dan Morgan is an important contributor to the System.Data related assemblies but their code and has contributions that have touched plenty of areas in the Mono project as well as helping with the Win32 installers on the early Mono days.

Tim Coleman
-----------

Tim Coleman contributions span System.Data and set the foundation for some of the later work on System.Web.Services and has contributed all around Mono.

Todd Berman
-----------

Todd Berman is a steady contributor to Mono. He has worked everywhere: from the Class Libraries, to the early implementation of the GAC and most recently has lead the effort to develop, port and maintain MonoDevelop an IDE for the Mono environment. His help has been key to the development of Mono.

Zoltan Varga
------------

Zoltan has contributed significantly to Mono, with bug reports and bug fixes as well as pushing the envelope of the things that can be done in and with the mono runtime: the gcc-based ngen compiler, code coverage and more recently his work with Reflection.Emit that got mono to the point of running the IKVM Java virtual machine.

Sergey Chaban
-------------

Sergey has been a long time contributor to the project, from the early work on the class libraries that were critical to Mono's origin: every time you use a Hashtable in Mono, it runs Sergey's code, to the low-level optimizations on the JIT engine and to his work on ILASM and the PEToolkit. And countless other things.

Nick Drochak
------------

The first, deserved, entry in the Mono Hackers Hall Of Fame is for Nick Drochak, who joined us in the first days of Mono and built the testing infrastructure for the C\# assemblies, fixed tons of bugs and even adventured himself in the lands of the C runtime. His work is invaluable for keeping Mono on the right track through the daily changes in the codebase.
