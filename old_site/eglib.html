<h1>Eglib</h1>

<p>eglib is an embedded glib library available in the <a href="http://github.com/mono/mono/tree/master/eglib" class="external text" rel="nofollow">mono repo</a>, which is a drop in replacement for glib for systems which don't have glib (or for users that prefer a reduced/slimmed version).
</p><p>eglib is not present in tarballs before version 2.7.
</p><p>For more information, read the <a href="http://github.com/mono/mono/blob/master/eglib/README" class="external text" rel="nofollow">README</a>.
