<h1>BuildSystem</h1>

<p>A system to automate some of our building, packaging, and testing is being worked on by Ben and Wade. This is in progress documentation of what the system contains.
</p><p>The first part of the system is the one which builds rpms. It is a set of scripts which knows how to ssh into chroot jails, checkout from svn, execute make dist, and then build rpms. There is documenation at <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/BuildSystem/PackagingScripts" title="BuildSystem/PackagingScripts">BuildSystem/PackagingScripts</a>.
</p><p>The output from the first system can be rsync'd to go-mono.com
</p><p>The second part is a buildbot-like system that will do automated building and testing. The system is being written in python, and is designed by Wade. Docs are at <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/BuildSystem/MonoBuild" title="BuildSystem/MonoBuild">BuildSystem/MonoBuild</a>
</p><p>Packagers and developers may find it helpful to look at the packaging scripts and sources for <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ThirdPartyPackages" title="ThirdPartyPackages">ThirdPartyPackages</a>.
