<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_Mono_exactly.3F"> What is Mono exactly? </span></h4>
<p>The Mono Project is an open development initiative sponsored by Ximian that is working to develop an open source, UNIX version of the Microsoft .NET development platform. Its objective is to enable UNIX developers to build and deploy cross-platform .NET Applications. The project will implement various technologies developed by Microsoft that have now been submitted to the ECMA for standardization.
</p><p>The Mono project has also sparked a lot of interest in developing C#-based components, libraries and frameworks. Today Mono is not limited to implement the .NET Framework, but also contains other components. Some of the components of the Mono platform were developed by the Mono team, and some others we have incorporated from other open source efforts, the most important ones:

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_the_difference_between_Mono_and_the_.NET_Initiative.3F"> What is the difference between Mono and the .NET Initiative? </span></h4>
<p>The ".NET Initiative" is a somewhat nebulous company-wide effort by Microsoft, one part of which is a cross-platform development framework. Mono is an implementation of the development framework, but not an implementation of anything else related to the .NET Initiative, such as Passport or software-as-a-service.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_technologies_are_included_in_Mono.3F"> What technologies are included in Mono? </span></h4>
<p>Mono contains a number of components useful for building new software:
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> A Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) virtual machine that contains a class loader, Just-in-time compiler, and a garbage collecting runtime.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> A class library that can work with any language which works on the CLR. Both .NET compatible class libraries as well as Mono-provided class libraries are included.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> A compiler for the C# language. In the future we might work on other compilers that target the Common Language Runtime.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
Windows has compilers that target the virtual machine from <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/net/thirdparty/default.asp#lang" class="external text" rel="nofollow">a number of languages:</a> Managed C++, Java Script, Eiffel, Component Pascal, APL, Cobol, Perl, Python, Scheme, Smalltalk, Standard ML, Haskell, Mercury and Oberon.
</p><p>The CLR and the Common Type System (CTS) enables applications and libraries to be written in a collection of different languages that target the byte code
</p><p>This means for example that if you define a class to do algebraic manipulation in C#, that class can be reused from any other language that supports the CLI. You could create a class in C#, subclass it in C++ and instantiate it in an Eiffel program.
</p><p>A single object system, threading system, class libraries, and garbage collection system can be shared across all these languages.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mono_and_GNOME"> Mono and GNOME </span></h2>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_is_Mono_related_to_GNOME.3F"> How is Mono related to GNOME? </span></h4>
<p>In a number of ways. This project was born out of the need of providing improved tools for the GNOME community, and will use existing components that have been developed for GNOME when they are available. For example, we plan to use Gtk+ and Libart to implement Winforms and the Drawing2D API and are considering GObject support.
</p><p>Mono team members work actively on the <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Gtk#</a> project: a binding of the GNOME class libraries for .NET and Mono.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Has_the_GNOME_Foundation_or_the_GNOME_team_adopted_Mono.3F"> Has the GNOME Foundation or the GNOME team adopted Mono? </span></h4>
<p>Mono is too new to be adopted by those groups. We hope that the tools that we will provide will be adopted by free software programmers including the GNOME Foundation members and the GNOME project generally.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Should_GNOME_programmers_switch_over_to_Mono_now.3F"> Should GNOME programmers switch over to Mono now? </span></h4>
<p>It is still far to early for discussions of "switching over." No pieces of Mono will be ready within the next six months, and a complete implementation is roughly one year away.
</p><p>We encourage GNOME developers to continue using the existing tools, libraries and components. Improvements made to GNOME will have an impact on Mono, as they would be the "back-end" for various classes.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Will_Mono_include_compatibility_with_Bonobo_components.3F_What_is_the_relationship_between_Mono_and_Bonobo.3F"> Will Mono include compatibility with Bonobo components? What is the relationship between Mono and Bonobo? </span></h4>
<p>Yes, we will provide a set of classes for implementing and using Bonobo components from within Mono. Mono should allow you to write Bonobo components more easily, just like .NET on Windows allows you to export .NET components to COM.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Does_Mono_depend_on_GNOME.3F"> Does Mono depend on GNOME? </span></h4>
<p>No, Mono does not depend on GNOME. We use a few packages produced by the GNOME team like the 'glib' library, we also use other third-party open source libraries like Cairo and ICU.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="But_will_I_be_able_to_build_GNOME_applications.3F"> But will I be able to build GNOME applications? </span></h4>
<p>Yes, we will enable people to write GNOME applications using Mono.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Do_you_have_C.23_bindings_for_GNOME.3F"> Do you have C# bindings for GNOME? </span></h4>
<p>.
</p><p>Yes, the <a href="http://gtk-sharp.sf.net" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Gtk# project</a> provides bindings for Gtk+, Gdk, Atk, libgnome, libgnomecanvas, and libgnomeui. Other libraries under the GNOME framework will be added on an as-needed (and as-requested) basis.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="GUI_applications"> GUI applications </span></h2>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Will_Mono_enable_GUI_applications_to_be_authored.3F"> Will Mono enable GUI applications to be authored? </span></h4>
<p>Yes, you will be able to build GUI applications. Indeed, that is our main focus. Today you can use Gtk# or #WT to develop GUI applications, and support for Windows.Forms is underway.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_the_difference_between_Gtk.23_and_System.Windows.Forms.3F"> What is the difference between Gtk# and System.Windows.Forms? </span></h4>
<p>Gtk# is a set of bindings for the Gtk+ toolkit for C# (and other CIL-enabled languages), it integrates natively with the Gnome desktop. System.Windows.Forms is an API defined by Microsoft to build GUI applications.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_are_you_using_to_implement_Windows.Forms.3F"> What are you using to implement Windows.Forms? </span></h4>
<p>See the &lt;a

</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_not_implement_System.Windows.Forms_on_top_of_Gtk.23_or_Qt.23.3F"> Why not implement System.Windows.Forms on top of Gtk# or Qt#? </span></h4>
<p>Compatibility.
</p><p>Although it is possible to run simple Windows.Forms applications with the Gtk#-based backend of Windows.Forms, it is very unlikely that the implementation will ever implement everything needed for full compatibility with Windows.Forms.
</p><p>The reason is that Windows.Forms is not a complete toolkit, and to work around this problem some of the underlying Win32 foundation is exposed to the programmer in the form of exposing the Windows message handler (WndProc). Any control can override this method. Also developers often P/Invoke into Win32 to get to functionality that was not wrapped.
</p><p>To achieve full compatibility, we would have to emulate this, and it would take too long.

<p>We have already a few patches into our version of Windows.Forms that makes Wine use the colors and font settings from your desktop, improving the integration a lot. In the future, we will continue to improve this interoperability scenario.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Will_I_be_able_to_run_my_smart_clients_on_systems_powered_by_Mono.3F"> Will I be able to run my smart clients on systems powered by Mono? </span></h4>
<p>As long as your applications are 100% .NET and do not make use of P/Invoke to call Win32 functions, your smart client applications will run on Mono platforms.

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_can_I_do_with_Gtk.23.3F"> What can I do with Gtk#? </span></h4>
<p>.
</p><p>Gtk# is becoming very usable and you can create applications and applets like those you see in a GNOME desktop environment. It's easy to install so it's worth a try.

<p>There is a sample file called 'DbClient' in gtk-sharp/samples that you might to look at. It is a sample program in Gtk# that adds/updates/deletes information on a Postgress database. When we have the new table/tree widgets, I am sure someone would write an adapter for System.Data (in Gtk2 the tree/list widgets are written using a view/model, so you only need to write a model that maps to the database). You can have a look at gtk-sharp/sample/DbClient, where there is a Gtk# application that uses System.Data. It does not use DataAdapter, but DataReader though.

<p>There is no high level communication between Ximian and Microsoft at this point, but engineers who work on .NET or the ECMA groups have been very friendly, and very nice to answer our questions, or clarify part of the specification for us.
</p><p>Microsoft is interested in other implementations of .NET and are willing to help make the ECMA spec more accurate for this purpose.
</p><p>Ximian was also invited to participate in the ECMA committee meetings for C# and the CLI.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Are_Microsoft_or_Corel_paying_Ximian_to_do_this.3F"> Are Microsoft or Corel paying Ximian to do this? </span></h4>
<p>No.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Do_you_fear_that_Microsoft_will_change_the_spec_and_render_Mono_useless.3F"> Do you fear that Microsoft will change the spec and render Mono useless? </span></h4>
<p>No. Microsoft proved with the CLI and the C# language that it was possible to create a powerful foundation for many languages to inter-operate. We will always have that.
</p><p>Even if changes happened in the platform which were undocumented, the existing platform would a value on its own.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Are_you_writing_Mono_from_the_ECMA_specs.3F"> Are you writing Mono from the ECMA specs? </span></h4>
<p>Yes, we are writing them from the ECMA specs and the published materials in print about .NET.

<p>No. The Mono Project is focused on providing a compatible set of tools for the Microsoft .NET development platform. It does not address, require, or otherwise endorse the MS Passport-based Hailstorm single sign-on system that is part of Windows XP and other services.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Will_Mono_or_.NET_applications_depend_on_Microsoft_Passport.3F"> Will Mono or .NET applications depend on Microsoft Passport? </span></h4>

<p>Mono today ships with a Just-in-Time compiler for x86, PowerPC and SPARC-based systems. It is tested regularly on Linux, FreeBSD and Windows (with the XP/NT core).
</p><p>There is also an interpreter, which is slower that runs on the s390, SPARC, HPPA, StrongARM and PowerPC architectures.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Can_Mono_run_on_Windows_9x.2C_or_ME_editions.3F"> Can Mono run on Windows 9x, or ME editions? </span></h4>
<p>Mono requires Unicode versions of Win32 APIs to run, and only a handful of 
</p>
<ul><li>W functions is supported under Win9x.
</li></ul>
<p>There is Microsoft Layer for Unicode that provides implementation of these APIs on 9x systems.
</p><p>Unfortunately it uses linker trick for delayed load that is not supported by ld, so some sort of adapter is necessary. You will need MSLU and one of the following libs to link Mono to unicows.dll <a href="http://mono.eurosoft.od.ua/files/unimono.zip" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://mono.eurosoft.od.ua/files/unimono.zip</a> or alternatively search the net for "libunicows".
</p><p>No changes to Mono source code required, the only thing is to make sure that linker will resolve imports to adapter library instead of Win32 libs. This is achieved by inserting -lunimono before -lkerner32/user32 in the linker's specs file.

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_support_Windows.2C_when_you_can_run_the_real_thing.3F"> Why support Windows, when you can run the real thing? </span></h4>
<p>There are various reasons:
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  About half the contributors to Mono are Windows developers. They have many different for contributing to the effort, and we find it very important to let those developers run the runtime on Windows without forcing them to use a new operating system.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Supporting Windows helps us identify the portable portions of Mono from the non-portable versions of it, helping Mono become more portable in the future.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Mono does not heavily modify the windows registry, update system DLLs, install DLLs to the Windows/System32 path. Another words, I knew Mono would not cause any legacy enterprise applications to stop working - and it hasn't. However, our CIO er is againt it because of the changes that would be made to Windows 2000, such as, affecting security.

<p>Yes, we will. But we will need your assistance for this. If you find a bug in the Mono implementation, please fill a bug report in <a href="http://bugzilla.ximian.com" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://bugzilla.ximian.com</a>. Do not assume we know about the problem, we might not, and using the bug tracking system helps us organize the development process.

<p>Yes, you can.
</p><p>As of today, Mono is not 100% finished, so it is sometimes useful to compile the code with Mono, to find out if your application depends on unimplemented functionality.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Will_applications_run_out_the_box_with_Mono.3F"> Will applications run out the box with Mono? </span></h4>
<p>Sometimes they will. But sometimes a .NET application might invoke Win32 API calls, or assume certain patterns that are not correct for cross-platform applications.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_is_a_100.25_.NET_application.3F"> What is a 100% .NET application? </span></h4>
<p>A '100% .NET application' is one that only uses the APIs defined under the System namespace and does not use P/Invoke. These applications would in theory run unmodified on Windows, Linux, HP-UX, Solaris, MacOS X and others.
</p><p>Note that this requirement also holds for all assemblies used by the application. If one of them is Windows-specific, then the entire program is not a 100% .NET application.
</p><p>Furthermore, a 100% .NET application must not contain non-standard data streams in the assembly. For example, Visual Studio .NET will insert a <tt>#-</tt> stream into assemblies built under the "Debug" target. This stream contains debugging information for use by Visual Studio .NET; however, this stream can not be interpreted by Mono (unless you're willing to donate support).
</p><p>Thus, it is recommended that all Visual Studio .NET-compiled code be compiled under the Release target before it is executed under Mono.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Can_I_execute_my_Visual_Studio_.NET_program_.28Visual_Basic_.NET.2C_Visual_C.23.2C_Managed_Extensions_for_C.2B.2B.2C_etc..29_under_Mono.3F"> Can I execute my Visual Studio .NET program (Visual Basic .NET, Visual C#, Managed Extensions for C++, etc.) under Mono? </span></h4>
<p>Yes, with some reservations.
</p><p>The .NET program must either be a 100% .NET application, or (somehow) have all dependent assemblies available on all desired platforms. (How to do so is outside the bounds of this FAQ.)
</p><p>Mono must also have an implementation for the .NET assemblies used. For example the System.EnterpriseServices namespace is part of .NET, but it has not been implemented in Mono. Thus, any applications using this namespace will not run under Mono.
</p><p>With regards to languages, C# applications tend to be most portable.
</p><p>Visual Basic .NET applications are portable, but Mono's Microsoft.VisualBasic.dll implementation is incomplete. It is recommended to either avoid using this assembly in your own code, only use the portions that Mono has implemented, or to help implement the missing features. Additionally, you can set 'Option Strict On', which eliminates the implicit calls to the unimplemented Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices.ObjectType class. (Thanks to JÃƒÂ¶rg Rosenkranz.)
</p><p>Managed Extensions for C++ is least likely to operate under Mono. Mono does not support mixed mode assemblies (that is, assemblies containing both managed and unmanaged code, which Managed C++ can produce). You need a fully-managed assembly to run under Mono, and getting the Visual C++ .NET compiler to generate such an executable can be difficult. You need to use only the .NET-framework assemblies, not the C libraries (you can't use <b>printf</b>(3) for example.), and you need to use the linker options <tt>/nodefaultlib /entry:main mscoree.lib</tt> in addition to the <tt>/clr</tt> compiler flag. You can still use certain compiler intrinsic functions (such as <b>memcpy</b>(3)) and the STL. You should also see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/vcmex/html/vcgrfconvertingmanagedextensionsforcprojectsfrommixed-modetopureil.asp" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Converting Managed Extensions for C++ Projects from Mixed Mode to Pure Intermediate Language</a> at MSDN. Finally, you can use PEVERIFY.EXE from the .NET SDK to determine if the assembly is fully managed.
</p><p>Thanks to Serge Chaban for the linker flags to use.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mono_and_Portable.NET"> Mono and Portable.NET </span></h2>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_are_the_differences_between_Mono_and_Portable.NET.3F"> What are the differences between Mono and Portable.NET? </span></h4>
<p>Most of Mono is being written using C#, with only a few parts written in C (The JIT engine, the runtime, the interfaces to the garbage collection system).
</p><p>It is easier to describe what is unique about Mono:
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> An advanced native-code compilation engine: Both just-in-time compilation (JIT) and pre-compilation of CIL bytecodes into native code are supported.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> A foundation for code optimization: The new code generator in Mono builds on the experience of our first JIT engine, and enables us to implement various advanced compiler optimization tricks. With an SSA-framework, plenty of new optimizations are possible.
</li></ul>
<p>The current list of optimizations are: Peephole postpass, Branch optimizations, Inline method calls, Constant folding, Constant propagation, Copy propagation, Dead code elimination, Linear scan global reg allocation, Conditional moves, Emit per-domain code, Instruction scheduling, Intrinsic method implementations, Tail recursion and tail calls, Loop related optimizations, Fast x86 FP compares, Leaf procedures optimizations
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> A self-hosting C# compiler written in C#, which is clean, easy to maintain.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> Focus on the .NET Framework: we are tracking down the .NET Framework API definition, as we believe it is the API people will be most familiar with.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> A multi-platform runtime engine: both a JIT engine and an interpreter exist. The JIT engine runs currently on x86, PowerPC and Sparc systems, while the interpreter works on x86, SPARC, StrongARM, s390 and PowerPC systems.
</li></ul>
<p>The JIT engine is being ported to PowerPC, s390, SPARC and amd64 systems as of this time.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> Supports Linux, BSD, MacOS, Windows and Solaris at this point.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  The JIT engine is written using a portable instruction selector which not only generates good code but is also the foundation to re-target the JIT engine to other systems.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> Full support for remoting in the runtime.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li> The C# compiler, the JIT engine and the class libraries are mature enough that the whole system has been self-hosting since April 2002. This means that we develop Mono completely with itself at this point.
</li></ul>
<p>By forcing ourselves to use our own code to develop our tools, we bug fix problems rapidly, and the system is overall more robust and tested than if we did not.
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Our class libraries are licensed under the terms of the MIT X11 license which is a very liberal license as opposed to the GNU GPL with exceptions, this means that Mono can be used in places where the GPL with exceptions is not permissible.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Mono has a complete Web Services stack: we implement ASP.NET web servers and web clients as well as implementing the Remoting-based SOAP infrastructure.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Remoting implementation: Mono has a complete remoting infrastructure that is used in our own codebase to provide added functionality and performance to our ASP.NET engine and more.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Mono has a complete <a href="/index.php?title=C_Sharp&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="C Sharp (page does not exist)">C# 1.0</a> implementation and has been stress tested a lot more than Portable.NET's compiler.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Mono's C# compiler has strong error handling and has closer adherence to the specification.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Mono's C# compiler is written in C# which is easier for new developers to come in and improve, fix and tune. The Mono C# compiler in C# is faster than their C-based compiler.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Preview of C# 2.0: a work in progress for a 2.0 implementation of our compiler is available (iterators, generics and anonymous methods are available in our "preview" compiler).
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Mono has a complete Reflection and Reflection.Emit: these are important for advanced applications, compilers and dynamic code generation.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Mono has a [[|complete managed XML stack]]: XML, XPath, XML Serializer, XML Schema handling are fully functional, feature complete and tuned for performance.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Mono has a [[|complete cryptography stack]]: we implement the 1.0 and 1.1 APIs as well as using our fully managed stack to implement the SSL/TLS transports.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/ADO.NET" title="ADO.NET">Extensive database support</a>: Mono ships with database provides for <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/Firebird_Interbase" title="Firebird Interbase">Firebird</a>, <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/IBM_DB2" title="IBM DB2">IBM DB2</a>, <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/Oracle" title="Oracle">Oracle</a>, <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/Sybase" title="Sybase">Sybase</a>, Microsoft <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/TDS_Generic" title="TDS Generic">SQL Server</a>, <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/SQL_Lite" title="SQL Lite" class="mw-redirect">SQL Lite</a>, <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/MySQL" title="MySQL">MySQL</a>, ="postgresql"&gt;PostgresSQL&lt;/A&gt;, <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/OLE_DB" title="OLE DB">Ole DB</a> and <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/ODBC" title="ODBC">ODBC</a>.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  Mono includes full LDAP support.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul><li>  We have a great community of developers, without which Mono would not be possible.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
In general, Mono is more mature and complete since it has been used to develop itself, which is a big motivator for stability and correctness, while Portable.NET remains pretty much an untested platform.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="I_hear_Mono_keeps_changing_the_P.2FInvoke_API.2C_why.3F"> I hear Mono keeps changing the P/Invoke API, why? </span></h4>
<p>We are just fixing our implementation to be compatible with the Microsoft implementation. In other words, the Mono P/Invoke API is more complete when compared to the Portable.NET version, hence various pieces of software that depend on this extended functionality fail to work properly with Portable.NET.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Web_Services"> Web Services </span></h2>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_is_Mono_related_to_Web_Services.3F"> How is Mono related to Web Services? </span></h4>
<p>Mono is only related to Web Services in that it will implement the same set of classes that have been authored in the .NET Framework to simplify and streamline the process of building Web Services.
</p><p>But most importantly, Mono is an Open Source implementation of the .NET Framework.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Can_I_author_Web_Services_with_Mono.3F"> Can I author Web Services with Mono? </span></h4>
<p>You will be able to write Web Services on .NET that run on Mono and vice-versa.

<p>Yes. When the project is finished, you will be able to use the same technologies that are available through the .NET Framework SDK on Windows to write Web Services.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_about_Soup.3F_Can_I_use_Soup_without_Mono.3F"> What about Soup? Can I use Soup without Mono? </span></h4>
<p>Soup is a library for GNOME applications to create SOAP servers and SOAP clients, and can be used without Mono. You can browse the source code for soup using <a href="http://cvs.gnome.org/bonsai/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">GNOME's Bonsai</a>.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Can_I_use_CORBA.3F"> Can I use CORBA? </span></h4>
<p>Yes. The CLI contains enough information about a class that exposing it to other RPC systems (like CORBA) is really simple, and does not even require support from an object.
</p><p><a href="http://remoting-corba.sourceforge.net/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Remoting.CORBA</a> is a CORBA implementation that is gaining momentum.
</p><p>Building an implementation of the Bonobo interfaces once this is ready should be relatively simple.

<p>Yes, although the serializing tools have not yet been planned, and you would probably have to implement them yourself.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Will_Mono_use_ORBit.3F"> Will Mono use ORBit? </span></h4>
<p>There are a few advantages in using ORBit, like reusing existing code and leveraging all the work done on it.

<p>ion 74:&lt;/b&gt; I am having trouble compiling a new version of Mono from CVS, it complains about my runtime being out of sync.
</p><p>To upgrade your class libraries and compiler, see the INSTALL.txt in the MCS directory.
</p><p>The single biggest source of confusion seems to be the "Your runtime is out of sync" messages. Realize that this is 
</p>
<ul><li>normal
</li><li> while BUILDING. Think about it: you're building a new class library with the old runtime. If the new class library references a function that the old runtime knows nothing about, the runtime system issues this warning.
</li></ul>
<p>Basically what needs to happen is for a new mono runtime to be compiled, then the corlib class library be compiled, and once this is done, install the new runtime, followed by corlib.
</p><p>Once this is done, you can continue building your entire environment.
</p><p>For instance you just need to: 1.- Upgrade your Mono runtime (you might better do it with the mono-build.sh script available <a href="/index.php?title=Special:Upload&amp;wpDestFile=Mono-build.sh" class="new" title="File:Mono-build.sh">here</a>). 2.- Get the latest mono-lite tarball from the daily snapshots <a href="http://www.go-mono.com/daily/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">page</a>, unzip and untar and copy all the dll files to your install path lib directory (typically pointed by the $MONO_PATH variable). Copy all the exe files to the install path bin directory. 3.- Then checkout or update your mcs CVS copy. Then follow the steps described in mcs/INSTALL.txt.

<p>Yes. The CLI engine will be made available as a shared library. The garbage collection engine, the threading abstraction, the object system, the dynamic type code system and the JIT are available for C developers to integrate with their applications if they wish to do so.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Will_you_have_new_development_tools.3F"> Will you have new development tools? </span></h4>
<p>With any luck, Free Software enthusiasts will contribute tools to improve the developer environment. These tools could be developed initially using the Microsoft implementation of the CLI and then executed later with Mono.
</p><p>We are recommending people to use and contribute to existing projects like SharpDevelop, Anjuta and Eclipse.

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_kind_of_rules_make_the_Common_Intermediate_Language_useful_for_JITers.3F"> What kind of rules make the Common Intermediate Language useful for JITers? </span></h4>
<p>The main rule is that the stack in the CLI is not a general purpose stack. You are not allowed to use it for other purposes than computing values and passing arguments to functions or return values.
</p><p>At any given call or return instruction, the types on the stack have to be the same independently of the flow of execution of your code.

</p><p>The JVM is not designed to be a general purpose virtual machine. The Common Intermediate Language (CIL), on the other hand, is designed to be a target for a wide variety of programming languages, and has a set of rules designed to be optimal for JITers.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Could_Java_target_the_CLI.3F"> Could Java target the CLI? </span></h4>
<p>Yes, Java could target the CLI, Microsoft's J# compiler does that.
</p><p>The <a href="http://weblog.ikvm.net/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">IKVM</a> project builds a Java runtime that works on top of .NET and on top of Mono. IKVM is essentially a JIT compiler that translates from JVM bytecodes into CIL instructions, and then lets the native JIT engine take over.

<p>What you can do with mono is to load different applications in their own application domain: this is a feature of the CLR that allows sandboxing applications inside a single process space. This is usualy exploited to compartmentalize different parts of the same app, but it can also be effectively used to reduce the startup and memory overhead. Using different appdomains the runtime representation of types and methods is shared across applications.

<p>We can not predict the future, but a conservative estimate is that it would be at least 'as fast as other JIT engines'.
</p><p>Mono's JIT engine has been recently re-architected, and it provides many new features, and layers suitable for optimization. It is relatively easy to add new optimizations to Mono.
</p><p>The CIL has some advantages over the Java byte code: The existance of structs in addition to classes helps a lot the performance and minimizes the memory footprint of applications.
</p><p>Generics in the CLI world are first-class citizens, they are not just a strong-typing addition to the language. The generic specifications are embedded into the instruction stream, the JIT uses this information to JIT a unique instances of a method that is optimized for the type arguments.
</p><p>The CIL is really an intermediate representation and there are a number of restrictions on how you can emit CIL code that simplify creating better JIT engines.
</p><p>For example, on the CIL, the stack is not really an abstraction available for the code generator to use at will. Rather, it is a way of creating a postfix representation of the parsed tree. At any given call point or return point, the contents of the stack are expected to contain the same object types independently of how the instruction was reached.

<p>First some background information.
</p><p>The .NET Framework is divided in two parts: the ECMA/ISO covered technologies and the other technologies developed on top of it like ADO.NET, ASP.NET and Windows.Forms.
</p><p>Mono implements the ECMA/ISO covered parts, as well as being a project that aims to implement the higher level blocks like ASP.NET, ADO.NET and Windows.Forms.
</p><p>The Mono project has gone beyond both of those components and has developed and integrated third party class libraries, the most important being: Debugging APIs, integration with the Gnome platform (Accessibility, Pango rendering, Gdk/Gtk, Glade, GnomeUI), Mozilla, OpenGL, extensive database support (Microsoft only supports a couple of providers out of the box, while Mono has support for 11 different providers), our POSIX integration libraries and finally the embedded API (used to add scripting to applications and host the CLI, or for example as an embedded runtime in Apache).
</p><p>The core of the .NET Framework, and what has been patented by Microsoft falls under the ECMA/ISO submission. Jim Miller at Microsoft has made a statement on the patents covering ISO/ECMA, (he is one of the inventors listed in the patent): <a href="https://mailserver.di.unipi.it/pipermail/dotnet-sscli/msg00218.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
</p><p>Basically a grant is given to anyone who want to implement those components for free and for any purpose.
</p><p>The controversial elements are the ASP.NET, ADO.NET and Windows.Forms subsets. Those are convenient for people who need full compatibility with the Windows platform, but are not required for the open source Mono platform, nor integration with today's Mono's rich support of Linux.
</p><p>The Mono strategy for dealing with these technologies is as follows: (1) work around the patent by using a different implementation technique that retains the API, but changes the mechanism; if that is not possible, we would (2) remove the pieces of code that were covered by those patents, and also (3) find prior art that would render the patent useless.
</p><p>Not providing a patented capability would weaken the interoperability, but it would still provide the free software / open source software community with good development tools, which is the primary reason for developing Mono.
</p><p>The patents do not apply in countries where software patents are not allowed.
</p><p>For Linux server and desktop development, we only need the ECMA components, and things that we have developed (like Gtk#) or Apache integration.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Is_Mono_only_an_implementation_of_the_.NET_Framework.3F"> Is Mono only an implementation of the .NET Framework? </span></h4>

<p>You can use the bundle functionality in Mono.
</p><p>This would bundle your binary inside a Mono runtime instance, so you distribute a single executable that contains the code inside. Notice that for this to work and be practical, you need to get a commercial license to the Mono runtime.
</p><p>The reason is that the bundle functionality is covered by the LGPL: so you would have to distribute your assemblies separatedly to allow developers to relink mono which would defeat the purpose of bundling for obscuring your code.
</p><p>It is not impossible to break, just like any other obfuscators.
</p><p>That being said, value these days does not lie in particular tiny routines, but lies in the large body of work, and if someone steals your code, you are likely going to find out anyways.
</p>
<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Any_other_option.3F"> Any other option? </span></h4>
<p>You could precompile with --aot your code, then disassemble the original .exe, and remove all the code, then re-assemble and ship both the vessel .exe and the precompiled code.
</p><p>This is not a supported configuration of Mono, and you would be on your own in terms of dealing with bugs and problems here.
</p><p>Get the companies that build the obfuscation packages to read the ECMA spec and fix the bugs in their products that generate non-standard binaries (or, if they expose a bug in mono, please file a report in our bugzilla).
</p><p>Pay Ximian/Novell to spend the development time needed to get mono to support the broken binaries that some of the obfuscation packages generate (or contribute that support).

<p>The key difference between CORBA (and COM) and the CLI is that the CLI allows "data-level interoperability" because every language/component uses the same data layout and memory management.
</p><p>This means you can operate directly upon the data types that someone else provides, without having to go via their interfaces. It also means you don't have to "marshal" (convert) parameters (data layouts are the same, so you can just pass components directly) and you don't have to worry about memory management, because all languages/components share the same garbage collector and address space. This means much less copying and no need for reference counting.

<h4> <span class="mw-headline" id="Does_Mono_support_generics.3F"> Does Mono support generics? </span></h4>
<p>.
</p><p>Yes, the Mono runtime now supports the new Generics extensions, and there is also support for generics in our new compiler: 'gmcs'.
</p><p>The Mono C# 1.0 compiler (mcs) will ship with various C# 2.0 features, but generics will remain on the separate compiler (gmcs) as this code is not as tested as the main compiler.
