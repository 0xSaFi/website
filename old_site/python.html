<h1>Python</h1>

<p>Mono supports <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=IronPython" class="external text" rel="nofollow">IronPython</a>, an open-source implementation of Python on the .NET framework. 
</p><p>Since IronPython depends on a lot of Net 2.0 functionality which might not be
implemented on mono, older mono releases might not compile/run newer IronPython
releases. Check the Release Notes of your mono release to see which IronPython
release is supported. The SVN version of mono can usually run the latest
IronPython release a short time after it is released.
</p><p><a href="http://www.go-mono.com/archive/1.1.17.1/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Mono 1.1.17</a> or later is required to run IronPython 1.0.
