<p>Ecma Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) Standard - Working Draft
</p><p>In August, 2000, the specification for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) was submitted to the international standardization organization Ecma. As a result, Ecma formed a task group (TG3) within TC39 (now moved to TC49), its technical committee responsible for programming languages and application development. This specification became known as Ecma-335.
</p><p>Since the initial submission, various Ecma member companies and individual contributors have produced two editions of the CLI standard, one in 2002 and one in 2006. Each Ecma edition was also submitted and approved by the International Standards Organization (ISO), specifically ISO/IEC JTC 1. The Ecma CLI specification went through the ISO/IEC JTC 1 Fast-Track process and the resulting document is referred to as ISO/IEC 23271. Because Ecma adopts the equivalent ISO document as another edition, the Ecma-335 CLI standard is officially at its 4th edition as of June 2006.
</p><p>A differently formatted version of each of these documents is being produced for final publication as
</p>
<ol><li> ISO/IEC standards and TR (1st edition). To monitor the progress of the publications, please visit <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=42927" class="external free" rel="nofollow">http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=42927</a>

<p>Work on the 5th edition of Ecma-335 CLI standard began in mid-2009. The TC49-TG3 task group is working on extending both the virtual machine and class libraries of the CLI specification. In addition, improvements are being made to clarify existing elements of the specification.  Many of these improvements are the result of feedback received from outside the task group, for which the task group is grateful.
</p><p>Posted below is a snapshot of the committee’s work as of 27 March 2010.
