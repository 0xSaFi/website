<h1>Certificate of Origin</h1>

<p>Certificates of origin is a practice that was born out of the Linux kernel world, and its something that we are starting to adopt in Mono.
</p><p>This is inspired by <a href="http://linux.yyz.us/patch-format.html" class="external text" rel="nofollow">this</a>.
</p><p><br />
</p><p>The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right to pass it on as a open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify the below: 
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Developer.27s_Certificate_of_Origin_1.1"> Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 </span></h1>
<p>By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:
</p><p>(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or
</p><p>(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated  in the file; or
</p><p>(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified  it.
</p><p>(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution  are public and that a record of the contribution (including all personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is  maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with  this project or the open source license(s) involved.
</p><p>then you just add a line at the end of your patch description, saying 
</p><p>Signed-off-by: Random J Developer &lt;random@developer.org&gt;
</p>
