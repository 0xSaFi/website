<h1>ServerSideTasks</h1>

<p>(This was originally a memo by atsushieno)
</p><p>Here is the list of what we don't have in Mono yet. [foo] refers to
the version. [3.5+] means 3.5 SP1.
</p>
<ul><li> ADO.NET
<ul><li> Linq to SQL [3.5]: it depends on dblinq effort. Currently it has about 100 todos. Some of them are not easy. There's also complexity on multiple database support and connection string.
</li><li> Linq to Entities (EF) [3.5+]: I wrote an analysis <a href="http://www.mono-project.com/EntityFramework" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</a>.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> ASP.NET 3.5/SP1 data involved stuff
<ul><li> LinqDataSource [3.5] depends on L2SQL. grendel is going to implement it based on .NET's L2SQL.
</li><li> EntityDataSource [3.5+] depends on EF.
</li><li> DynamicData [3.5+] depends on both above.
</li><li> (MVC is for 4.0 or later and hence should move from Mono 2.6 to later versions)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> WF (workflow) [3.0] - it is in olive so far.
<ul><li> every core things updates from current code to RTM (ComponentModel, Runtime and Activities).
</li><li> a huge amount of missing stuff here. (500 missings in activities and runtime for each, 1200 missing in component.)
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> WCF
<ul><li> SOAP in System.ServiceModel [3.0]. client for SL2 would work. Not-well-designed and unstable server.
</li><li> SAML [3.0]
</li><li> WS-* support [3.0] is largely incomplete. Security stack was a big mess. No duplex support yet.
</li><li> Cardspace [3.0] is an applied WS-* support + UI (could be anything).
</li><li> System.WorkflowServices [3.5] depends on WF.
</li><li> Data Services [3.5+] depends on WebHttpBinding [3.5] (which is done) and EF.
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
