<h1>Development Environments</h1>

<p>The Mono project focuses on compilers and runtime libraries and does not directly provide an IDE.  Developers must choose from a series of available tools the one best suited for them.

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="MonoDevelop"> MonoDevelop </span></h2>
<p><a href="http://www.monodevelop.org" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Monodevelop</a> is a Mono/C# Integrated Developement Environment for Linux and MacOS X.
</p><p>In late 2003, a few developers from the Mono community began migrating SharpDevelop, a successful .NET open source IDE from System.Windows.Forms on Windows to Gtk# on Linux. Since Mono 1.0 Beta 2, MonoDevelop is bundled with Mono releases and is available from the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Downloads" title="Downloads">Mono download page</a> 
</p><p>MonoDevelop parses your C# and VB programs as you type them and is able to provide contextual completion of methods.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Eclipse"> Eclipse </span></h2>
<p>The Eclipse IDE can be used to edit C# code, but lacks completion of methods.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Unix_tools"> Unix tools </span></h2>
<p>As you might expect, there are many development tools available to C# developers, ranging from bare-bones text editors to complex integrated development environments.
</p><p><b>Using Emacs or Vim</b>
</p><p>Emacs and Vim are general purpose text editors, not IDEs designed for use with .NET and C#. However, you can use them to write software in nearly any language.
</p><p>For Emacs, you will want to use the C# major mode available at <a href="http://davh.dk/script" class="external text" rel="nofollow">davh.dk</a> or <a href="http://www.cybercom.net/~zbrad/DotNet/Emacs" class="external text" rel="nofollow">www.cybercom.net</a> to handle syntax coloring and proper indentation.
</p><p>Vim supports syntax highlighting for C#, but not much else.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="X-Develop"> X-Develop </span></h2>
<p>Recently a commercial IDE for Java and C# has been launched, you can find it <a href="http://www.x-develop.com/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">here</a>
