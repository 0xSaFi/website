<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Upgrading_to_the_Latest_Gtk.23_Version"> Upgrading to the Latest Gtk# Version </span></h1>
<p>This page is a repository of answers to typical upgrading related questions between major Gtk# releases.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_do_I_update_my_1.0_application_to_compile_against_2.x.3F"> How do I update my 1.0 application to compile against 2.x? </span></h3>
<p>Most applications use pkg-config to detect Gtk# and obtain the reference arguments for their compilations.  If you are using the PKG_CONFIG_CHECK macro during configure or the -pkg: switch on mcs, you will need to make them look for gtk-sharp-2.0.pc instead of gtk-sharp.pc (e.g. -pkg:gtk-sharp-2.0).
</p>
<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="How_do_I_use_the_newest_GAPI_parser.2Fgenerator.3F"> How do I use the newest GAPI parser/generator? </span></h3>
<p>The 2.x versions of the parser/generator are named gapi2-parser and gapi2-codegen.  They are parallel installable with the 1.0 versions, so they had to be renamed.  You should strongly consider upgrading, as many parser/generator enhancements have been added which could not realistically be backported to the stable 1.0 releases.  Using GAPI 2.x will also effectively add a glib-sharp 2.x dependency though, so you can not use GAPI 2.x with the Gtk# 1.0 assemblies.  You will have to upgrade both.

<h3> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_happened_to_Gda.23_and_GnomeDb.23.3F"> What happened to Gda# and GnomeDb#? </span></h3>
<p>We aren't aware of anyone who was actually using them, and it is not clear that they were even usable based on some fundamental broken-ness like Gda.Value. We have provided a patch to the gnomedb project to integrate the bindings directly into gda/gnomedb where they will hopefully receive much more attention than we were able to give them in Gtk# .
