<h1>User:BenOSteen</h1>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Hi"> Hi </span></h2>
<p>I'm an Oxford, UK based linux enthusiast, soon to be a Software Engineer for Oxford University Library Services (18th September 2006).
</p><p>Contact me at monobosteen@maysubdivide.org
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Currently_working_on"> Currently working on </span></h2>
<p><a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/BosteenSand" title="BosteenSand" class="mw-redirect"> A sandbox page to see what reorganising and adding to the MonkeyGuide Desktop Application Development Guide would do. Is this a better structure for a new user? You tell me</a> 
</p><p>Two pre-existing pages that I have added to, or re-worded:
<a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/GtkSharp:_Widget_Overview" title="GtkSharp: Widget Overview">GtkSharp:_Widget_Overview</a>
<a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/GtkSharp:_Widget_Layout_and_Packing" title="GtkSharp: Widget Layout and Packing">GtkSharp:_Widget_Layout_and_Packing</a>
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Tutorial_Proposal"> Tutorial Proposal </span></h2>
<p>I am not personally convinced that dealing with the widgets on an individual basis is a good thing. As this is how the API is already structured, newbies will probably need a little more aid.
</p><p>I propose a series of tutorials, graded in difficultly. The narrative would be written to reflect the process and decisions made to get to the final product. I can write up the first tutorial to reflect what I mean soon. I am not putting this here, demanding submissions, but any help/examples using Gtk.Drawables in C# and perhaps even Mono.Cairo would be fantastic.

<ol><li> <b>Basic example, using the following:</b>
<ul><li> Should this be shown with Monodevelop and Stetic?
</li><li> hboxes and vboxes for layout
<ul><li> setting properties such as homogenous, width-request, and placement
</li></ul>
</li><li> Label
</li><li> Button
<ul><li> User defined at first and then replaced by a Stock button as the Better Way(tm)
</li></ul>
</li><li> Text Entry
</li><li> Functionality should cover basic event handling and application initiation:
<ol><li> User reads blurb
</li><li> Enters text
</li><li> Process text using a System.String method to introduce it
</li><li> If acceptable, set text entry to non-editable, and display a success message
</li><li> If not-acceptable, display a failure message.
</li></ol>
</li></ul>
</li><li> <b>First intermediate example, introducing the following:</b>
<ul><li> Frames 
<ul><li> setting properties such as naming, etc.
</li></ul>
</li><li> TextArea
</li><li> StringBuilder
</li><li> Dialog window Run and Dispose
</li><li> 'using' keyword
</li><li> Glade# design with Glade or Stetic in MonoDevelop
</li><li> Scrollbar container
</li><li> RegExpressions
</li><li> Functionality:
<ol><li> TextArea is not appended to directly, but with ToString() on a persistent StringBuilder object.
</li><li> Enter and handle text entry.
</li><li> RegExp words into other words.
</li><li> Dialog reports how many replacements/finds in entered text.
</li><li> Maintain TextEntry as a a rolling readout of responses.
</li></ol>
</li></ul>
</li><li> <b> Second intermediate example, introducing the following:</b>
<ul><li> Tooltips
</li><li> Progress Bars
</li><li> Radio/Checkbuttons
</li><li> Adjustments and Range Widgets
</li><li> Colour adjustments to widgets
</li><li> Responsive interface
</li><li> Functionality:
<ol><li> Haven't a clue yet... possibly a function plotter.
</li></ol>
</li></ul>
</li><li> <b> Third intermediate example </b>
<ul><li> Extend the previous example, using Menu Widgets, load and save, and XML...
</li><li> Sensible time to introduce NUnit testing? Or going even further, Test-Driven Development style of coding?
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
