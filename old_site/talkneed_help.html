<h1>Talk:Need Help</h1>

<p><a href="mailto:adrien.dessemond@softhome.net" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Adrien Dessemond</a> mentioned on the docs-list that this could be expanded by first-aid support for ASP.NET related stuff. In general a good idea, however since I've got no experience with this someone else should probably look into it and adapt the article.
