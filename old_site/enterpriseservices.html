<h1>EnterpriseServices</h1>

<p>At this point Mono does not support the EnterpriseServices namespace.
</p><p>Microsoft is phasing out EnterpriseServices in favor of Indigo, at this point an unreleased piece of software.
</p><p>Some consideration has been given to create a shared substrate that could be used by both an open source EnterpriseServices and an Indigo implementation, but little or no code has been produced.
</p><p>Some related components being developed and designed include:
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/Transactions" title="Transactions">Transactions processing</a>
</li><li> <a href="{{site.github.url}}/old_site/SystemMessaging" title="SystemMessaging" class="mw-redirect">Messaging support</a>
</li></ul>
