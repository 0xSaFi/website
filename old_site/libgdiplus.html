<h1>Libgdiplus</h1>

<p>Libgdiplus is the Mono library that provide a GDI+ comptible API on non-Windows operating systems. Our implementation uses <a href="http://www.cairographics.org" class="external text" rel="nofollow">Cairo</a> to do most of the heavy lifting.
</p><p>Mono's implementation of GDI+ lives in the <a href="http://anonsvn.mono-project.com/viewvc/trunk/libgdiplus/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">libgdiplus SVN module</a> and includes it's own internal copy of Cairo (version 1.6.4) but will use a newer system version when available (since Mono 2.4).
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="Plans"> Plans </span></h1>
<p>Due to it's tight relation with System.Drawing new versions of libgdiplus are released with (almost) every new version of Mono.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Text"> Text </span></h2>
<p>The current custom text engine is limited. GDI+ offers many (little used) options that are not, or incorrectly, supported by libgdiplus. The plan is to use Pango to replace our custom engine - but no work is being done on this task at the moment.
</p><p>A <i>proof-of-concept</i> is already in SVN but is <b>unsupported</b> and less complete than the current text engine. You can use <b>--with-pango</b> to enable it. Note that this will work <i>only</i> if you are building libgdiplus with the system cairo, i.e. if you're cairo library is newer than version 1.6.4.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Other_Tasks"> Other Tasks </span></h2>
<p>Cairo doesn't provide 100% of the functionalities required to implement GDI+ or System.Drawing. A few features were added directly in libgdiplus (unmanaged) or System.Drawing (managed). However some features are still missing.
</p>
<ul><li> add missing implementation for
<ul><li> <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=321034" class="external text" rel="nofollow">path gradient brush</a>
</li><li> <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=320856" class="external text" rel="nofollow">path widen</a>
</li><li> <a href="https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=400775" class="external text" rel="nofollow">path warp</a>
</li></ul>
</li><li> other missing stuff required for System.Drawing (fill bugs for them)
</li><li> other missing stuff, e.g. parts of the GDI+ API isn't exposed in System.Drawing (fill bugs for them)
</li></ul>
<p>Contributions toward completing those tasks are welcome.
