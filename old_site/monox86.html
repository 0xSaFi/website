<h1>Mono:X86</h1>

<p>Mono's main developers use x86 systems and its the most tuned version, currently it supports:
</p>
<ul><li> Linux.
</li><li> Windows.
</li><li> BSD (Requires a modern version for proper thread support).
</li><li> Solaris/x86
</li></ul>
<p>Mono on x86 supports both Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation as well as Ahead-of-Time (<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/AOT" title="AOT">AOT</a>) compilation, the later produces Position Independent Code.
</p>
<h1> <span class="mw-headline" id="X86_Specific_Optimizations"> X86 Specific Optimizations </span></h1>
<ul><li> Thread local storage (TLS): on systems that support TLS, Mono is able to take advantage of it.
</li><li> x86 peephole optimizations.
</li><li> Instruction selector is able to pick best instructions on x86.
</li></ul>
