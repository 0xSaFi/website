<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Download_Stats">Download Stats</span></h2>
<p>There are scripts to collect apache logs from ftp.novell.com and run webalizer against them.
</p><p>They are at:
</p>
<pre>release/website/download_stats
</pre>
<p>run './collect_and_gen_reports' from this directory.  An account on ftp.novell.com is required.
</p><p>This will create webalizer html output to:
</p>
<pre>output/www_ftp
</pre>
<p>and
</p>
<pre>output/www_http
</pre>
<p>Some distribution stats will be located at:
</p>
<pre>output/distro_stats.txt
</pre>
<p>that will give an idea of architecture and distribution popularity.
