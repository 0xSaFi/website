<h1>Talk:Cecil</h1>

<p>Is it the intention that Cecil will be feature-complete and convenient enough to allow people to easily implement their own .NET languages? I have been exploring the possibilities with domain-specific languages, and would really like a simple platform that allows me to produce problem-optimised IL code for them.
</p><p>Related to that I suppose, is the plan to have the Mono C# compiler make use of Cecil at some point?
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Cecil_as_a_platform_for_languages."> Cecil as a platform for languages. </span></h2>
<p>Cecil can certainly be used for that purpose (once write support is added), and hopefully we can start using it in various other tools.
</p><p>One day, it might be nice to move the C# compiler from Reflection.Emit to use Cecil (or something like Cecil), as
Reflection.Emit has some limitations that have lead to some ugly hacks.
</p>
<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Architecture_draft.3F"> Architecture draft? </span></h2>
<p>Is there anything like an architecture draft document available for Cecil? Or is the only way to find out more about it by checking out the source?
</p><p>PS: My main machine is a Windows platform... is there any reason that Cecil would not work under MS Framework 1.1?
