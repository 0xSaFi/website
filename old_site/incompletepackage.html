<h1>IncompletePackage</h1>

<p>If you get an error about an incomplete package while configuring Mono from the command line, this means that your distribution of Mono is incomplete.
</p><p>This is typically caused by using old versions of tar (in particular, this happens in Solaris). You can bypass this check by using the <b>--disable-solaris-tar-check</b> command line argument when running 'autogen.sh'.
</p><p>You must use a new tar program to decompress the Mono source code, as Mono contains very long directories and filenames that are not properly unpacked by older versions of tar.
</p><p>You can use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/tar/" class="external text" rel="nofollow">GNU Tar</a> for this.
</p><p>If you are getting this error <b>building from source</b>, please see: <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/Compiling_Mono" title="Compiling Mono">Compiling Mono</a>
