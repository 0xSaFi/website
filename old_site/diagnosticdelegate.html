<h1>Diagnostic:Delegate</h1>

<h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Your_Delegate_Has_Been_Garbage_Collected"> Your Delegate Has Been Garbage Collected </span></h2>
<p>The program that you are running passed a delegate into the unmanaged world but failed to keep a reference to this delegate in the managed world, so the delegate was garbage collected.
</p><p>This means that the the delegate is no longer valid, but the unmanaged library or code tried to call it.
</p><p>To fix this problem make sure that you keep a handle to the delegate that you are passing into the unmanaged world.
</p><p>This happens since Mono has no visibility into the unmanaged world and it does not know that the unmanaged world has kept a reference to your delegate.  As far as the Mono runtime is concerned the delegate must be garbage collected.
