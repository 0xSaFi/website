We have just pushed [mono 3.2.4](http://www.mono-project.com/Release_Notes_Mono_3.2#New_in_Mono_3.2.4 "Release Notes") out.

This is an OSX only release that has the PCL reference assemblies from Microsoft. Its contents are identical to 3.2.3 other than that.

It can be downloaded from the [usual place](http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html "Download Mono").
