title: Install Mono on Mac OS X
---

Installing Mono on Mac OS X is very simple:

1. [Download](/download/) the latest Mono release for Mac
2. Run the .pkg file and follow the installation wizard

After the installation completed successfully, it's a good idea to run through the basic hello world examples on [this page](/docs/getting-started/mono-basics/) to verify Mono is working correctly.
