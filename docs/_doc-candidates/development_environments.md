Development Environments
========================

The Mono project focuses on compilers and runtime libraries and does not directly provide an IDE. Developers must choose from a series of available tools the one best suited for them.

MonoDevelop
-----------

[Monodevelop](http://www.monodevelop.org) is a Mono/C\# Integrated Developement Environment for Linux and MacOS X.

In late 2003, a few developers from the Mono community began migrating SharpDevelop, a successful .NET open source IDE from System.Windows.Forms on Windows to Gtk\# on Linux. Since Mono 1.0 Beta 2, MonoDevelop is bundled with Mono releases and is available from the [Mono download page]({{site.github.url}}/old_site/Downloads "Downloads")

MonoDevelop parses your C\# and VB programs as you type them and is able to provide contextual completion of methods.

Eclipse
-------

The Eclipse IDE can be used to edit C\# code, but lacks completion of methods.

Unix tools
----------

As you might expect, there are many development tools available to C\# developers, ranging from bare-bones text editors to complex integrated development environments.

**Using Emacs or Vim**

Emacs and Vim are general purpose text editors, not IDEs designed for use with .NET and C\#. However, you can use them to write software in nearly any language.

For Emacs, you will want to use the C\# major mode available at [davh.dk](http://davh.dk/script) or [www.cybercom.net](http://www.cybercom.net/~zbrad/DotNet/Emacs) to handle syntax coloring and proper indentation.

Vim supports syntax highlighting for C\#, but not much else.

X-Develop
---------

Recently a commercial IDE for Java and C\# has been launched, you can find it [here](http://www.x-develop.com/)
