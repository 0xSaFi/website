Long way to go to the last public release.

= Highlights = 

* Adoption of Microsoft's open source code
* Floating point optimizations
* We dropped support for the 2.0, 3.5 and 4.0 assemblies
* Updated IKVM
* Lighter Debugger overhead

=== Floating Point Optimizations ===

Mono has historically chosen to use the highest possible precision for
all floating point operations.  This means that both 64-bit math and
32-bit math were done with the highest precision available.  

But performance sensitive code that might not need high precision was
negatively impacted.   

With this release we are introducing support for performing 32-bit
floating operations using 32-bit math.  This produces faster code at
the expense of fidelity.  This mdoe of operation can be enabled with
the `-O=float32` option.

With a sample Mandelbrot generator program, on x86-64 these are the
results:

|            |ARM32   |x86-64|
|------------|-------:|-----:|
|Original    |    1m56|  17.2|
|Origina/LLVM|        |  10.3|
|Float32     |    1m12|  12.2|
|Float32/LLVM|        |   8.8|

This option currently needs to be enabled manually, it is not part of
the `-O=all` options.

== Microsoft Source Code Adoption ==

This is the first release of Mono that replaces various components of
Mono with code that was released by Microsoft under the MIT license in
one of three places:

* Microsoft's ReferenceSource drop
* Microsoft's CoreFX
* Microsoft's CoreCLR

While Microsoft is working towards .NET Core: a redistributable and
re-imagined version of .NET, the project remains a work in progress.
Mono at this point continues to provide an API that tracks the .NET
desktop/server version.

This means that most of the code that we have integrated comes from
the ReferenceSource drop.  In the future, we will deliver a "Mono
Core" along the same lines of .NET Core to allow the use of the Mono
runtime with the new library distribution system that is being
developed with CoreFX.

In this release, we have either ported components that were either
incomplete or buggy in Mono and were relatively easy to port to Mono.
There is much more to be done in this area.  If you are interested in
tracking those efforts, check the project status:

https://trello.com/b/vRPTMfdz/net-framework-integration-into-mono

Mono ships now with a subset of the referencesource that have been
adjusted to work with Mono's class libraries or have been updated to
be cross platform.

=== Decimal ===

We have replaced Mono's System.Decimal implementation with Microsoft's
version.  This fixed a couple of formatting bugs.  While Mono's code
did not have any major bugs, Microsoft's implementation is more
efficient and is actively maintained.  Fixing bugs in System.Decimal
was always difficult.

=== Assorted Microsoft Classes Imported ===

These are some highlights of code imported from Microsoft (smaller
bits like exceptions, attributes, enumerations or other simple bits
are not shown):

* System:
** BitConverter
** Boolean
** DateTime
** TimeSpan
* System.Collections.Generic
** HashSet
* System.Globalization
** DaylightTime
* System.Linq.Parallel
** Entire stack replaced
* System.Net
** FtpWebRequest
* System.Threading
** ReaderWriterLockSlimExtensions
** Spinlock

== Garbage Collector ==

== Dropped Support for Old Frameworks ==

We no longer build or package reference assemblies for the .NET 2.0,
.NET 3.5 or .NET 4.0 APIs.  We only support now the .NET 4.5
assemblies as well as the mobile-based profiles.

The 4.0 reference assemblies are included for the sake of developers
using Mono to build libraries that should be deployed on systems that
use 4.0.

== Lighter Debugger Overhead ==
FIXME: add SeqPoint description
       
= Other Features =

* FLOAT<->INT conversion patches from Alex (FIXME: fill in details)
* New interrupt code (FIXME: fill in details)
* Improved the S390x support for float/int conversions
* Atomic exchange (FIXME: fill in details)
* Atomic Load/Stores
* Add support for HFAs on ARM64
* Added LLDB scripts to assist developers debugging the runtime with LLDB
* MonoIO method and classes now uses SafeHandles

== Fine tuning ==

We now inline copies of structures up to eight machine words, up from
the previous five.  Values larger than that still call memcpy to
complete the operation.

More methods can be compiled with LLVM on ARM.  This helps many
methods that passed large structures as parameters.

We improved the performance of Enum.HasFlag


== Linker/Preserve ==
Support for 

== MSBuild ==
Lluis' changes.
