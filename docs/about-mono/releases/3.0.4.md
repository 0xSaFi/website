title: New in Mono 3.0.4
---

Garbage Collector
-----------------

Many changes went into our GC implementation. We added long links support to our traditional Boehm collector. As for SGen, it is finally a true concurrent GC, with cementing support. We also fixed several bugs, such as \#9928 pointer free deadlock problem and bugs in mono\_gc\_weak\_link\_get.

Async
-----

Rewrite of async StreamReader/StreamWritter operations to not fail on subsequent async call. Fixes \#9761

ASP.NET
-------

Updated encoding support.

Some minor bug fixes.

Other improvements
------------------

New MONO\_DISABLE\_SHARED\_AREA environment variable lets you turn of the use of shared memory in Mono (used by performance counters and optionally by the io-layer).

Updated EntityFramework version that ships with Mono.

Support for ConnectionLifetime parameter in SqlClient (contributed by 7digital).

Fixed C\# Evaluator Terse reader with loops

Don't report user operator error during probing user conversions. Fixes \#10170.

Add explicit interface GetType implementation to avoid object::GetType become proxy. (C\# compiler fix)

Implement use of \_\_refvalue as an lvalue. Fixes \#10034.

Packaging
---------

We no longer install a /usr/bin/pkg-config on OSX, to stop clashing with Homebrew.
