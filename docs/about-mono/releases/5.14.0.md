! PREVIEW VERSION !


Highlights
==========

This is System.Windows.Forms major update release !

# In Depth

## Runtime

### Better generic sharing

Generic sharing has been improved to handle more cases where constrained calls for example when using generic interface constraints now works in AOT mode and does not require JIT fallback.

### Memory optimization for handles

Previously when a process required only a minimal number of handles fixed predefined size buffer was still allocated. This behaviour has been improved to allocate only necessary slots to reduce the amount of preallocated memory significantly in such situations.

### LLVM Inlining improvements

Base on more benchmarking results we tweaked LLVM inlining rules to be more aggressive because LLVM can do a better job by generating more optimized code. This can noticeably improve microbenchmark results for a relevant C# code.

### GC Handling of very large objects

Mono sgen GC didn't scan properly very large object due to a bug in our code. Usually, objects which are over 4GBs of memory could exhibit such behaviour which could even lead to random crashes for very large objects.

## Class Libraries

Filip Navara has contributed significant improvements to Mono's System.Windows.Forms implementation. Many quirks but also serious issues blocking his WinForms application running on Linux were merged making the implementation even more compatible with .NET.

## Tools

### C# compiler

The Mono C# compiler (mcs) C# 7.x support was extended to include support for following new language constructs

* digits separators
* binary literals
* stackalloc span conversion
* conditional ref expression

### F# Compiler

The bundled F# compiler has been updated to version 4.1.33
