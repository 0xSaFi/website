Release History
===============

! PREVIEW VERSION !


Highlights
==========

This is primary bug fixing release, over hundred issues were resolved in this release.

# In Depth

## Runtime

### Better generic sharing

Generic sharing has been improved to handle more cases where constrained calls for example when using generic interface constraints now works in AOT mode and does not require JIT fallback.

### Memory optimization for handles

Previously when a process required only a minimal number of handles fixed predefined size buffer was still allocated. This behaviour has been improved to allocate only necessary slots to reduce the amount of preallocated memory significantly in such situations.

## Tools

### C# compiler

The Mono C# compiler (mcs) C# 7.x support was extended to include support for following new language constructs

* digits separators
* binary literals
* stackalloc span conversion
* conditional ref expression
