title: Mono 4.4.2 Release Notes
version: 4.4.2
---

Mono 4.4.2 is a service release for the Mono 4.4 series.

Bug Fixes (incomplete list)
=========

* [#39100](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=39100) -  'library not loaded' error when using embedded mono
* [#41264](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41264) - System "Socket" tests fails on devices with System.ObjectDisposedException
* [#41874](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=41874) - Reflection throws AmbiguousMatchException when calling GetProperty on a class that inherits from a generic base class.

Improvments
===========

NuGet was updated to version 2.12.

Changes in the Linux packages
=============================

The Mono packages now depend on `binutils`. This is necessary for the AOT compilation to work since direct object file
emission was removed with [commit cc946ea5](https://github.com/mono/mono/commit/cc946ea5b9e3cbb020c66d8986ecd220ca7ba58c) and we rely on
the system assembler/linker now.
