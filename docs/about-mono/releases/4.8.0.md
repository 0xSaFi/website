Highlights
==========

### API additions for .NET Standard 2.0

We added APIs to comply with .NET Standard 2.0, which is still a work in progress at the time of this writing.
Note that in some cases an implementation is still missing and will throw at runtime.

Please check the [.NET Standard repository](https://github.com/dotnet/standard) on GitHub for more details about .NET Standard.

### Cross-compilation with MKBundle

The MKBundle tool has been updated to easily support cross-compilation, instead of using a native
compiler to compile a bundled executable, Mono has been altered to support payloads embedded in the
executable.

The payloads can include native libraries, machine configurations and others.   See the manual page
for `mkbundle` for details on how to use this new simplified bundling stack.
