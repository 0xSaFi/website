### API additions for .NET Standard 2.0

We added APIs to comply with .NET Standard 2.0, which is still a work in progress at the time of this writing.
Note that in some cases an implementation is still missing and will throw at runtime.

Please check the [.NET Standard repository](https://github.com/dotnet/standard) on GitHub for more details about .NET Standard.

### Cross-compilation with MKBundle

The MKBundle tool has been updated to easily support cross-compilation, instead of using a native
compiler to compile a bundled executable, Mono has been altered to support payloads embedded in the
executable.

To do this, use the new `--simple` command line option.   The new invocation looks like this:

```bash
$ mkbundle -o hello --simple hello.exe
```

You can configure the resulting bundle with some command line options that you wish to pass to the runtime, for example, the following would disable inlining:

```bash
mkbundle -o hello --options -O=-inline --simple hello.exe
```

The cross-compilation feature requires the Mono team to update the packages on the server and
might not be working during the alpha period, but will be available at ship time.  You can get
a list of the available targets from the server, and retrieve one of the targets like this:

```bash
$ mkbundle --list-targets
Cross-compilation targets available:
4.8.0-linux-libc2.13-amd64
4.8.0-linux-libc2.13-armel
4.8.0-linux-libc2.13-armhf
4.8.0-linux-libc2.13-i386
4.8.0-macos-10.7-amd64
4.8.0-macos-10.7-i386
4.8.2-linux-libc2.13-amd64
4.8.2-linux-libc2.13-armel
4.8.2-linux-libc2.13-armhf
4.8.2-linux-libc2.13-i386
4.8.2-macos-10.7-amd64
4.8.2-macos-10.7-i386

$ mkbundle --fetch-target 4.8.2-macos-10.7-i386
```

Then you can cross-compile like this:

```bash
$ mkbundle --cross 4.8.2-macos-10.7-i386 hello.exe -o hello-macos
```

We have also extended the tool to allow you to configure the environment variables that you 
wish your bundled executable uses at runtime (for example to set some Mono internal configuration
options with `--env`), distribute native libraries with `--library`, specify additional character
encodings with `--i18n` and specify a `machine.config` file with `--config`.

For an overview of all the new features, check the `mkbundle(1)` manual page.
