**THIS IS A DRAFT/WORK IN PROGRESS PLACEHOLDER OF THE 5.0 RELEASE NOTES**

Preview Releases

Runtime

### SIMD Acceleration support ###

Generating SIMD accelerated native code for the classes in the
Mono.Simd assembly is deprecated in this release, and it will be
removed in +2 releases. Users should transition to using the Vector
classes, which are part of the official .net class libraries.

Windows
=======

macOS
=====

The Mono.framework package that we distribute for macOS now uses the
AppleTLS stack for implementing our SSL/TLS transport.  This brings
full support for TLS 1.2 for `SslStream` and our various HTTP web
clients.

In the initial preview release, AppleTLS has two known issues:

* Under certain circumstances, programs using AppleTLS may halt and present a GUI dialog requesting keychain access. [More information and bugzilla entry here](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=54469).
* SecCertificateCreateWithData, and thus many X.509 functions, currently behave differently when given an invalid certificate on each of 10.9, 10.11, and 10.12. [Bugzilla entry here](https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=53689).

We do offer a way of using the old SSL/TLS stack. Set the
`MONO_TLS_PROVIDER` environment variable to `legacy` to use the old
Mono managed TLS 1.0 stack.   From your shell, you can do it like this:

```
export MONO_TLS_PROVIDER=legacy
```

CoreFX + Reference Source Adoption
----------------------------------

As we [announced](http://www.mono-project.com/news/2016/11/29/mono-code-sharing/) we are adopting
a new strategy to share code with .NET.   With this release we started this effort where the
code is shared between .NET Core and Mono and not just the Reference Source release.


Bug Fixes
=========

Environment Memory Management And System.Configuration
------------------------------------------------------
As per the Unix specification, getenv may return a pointer into static memory. Future calls to getenv can overwrite
the memory returned from previous calls to getenv. Mono kept many pointers into this memory while concurrently calling
getenv on multiple threads. We now lock around the environment-changing functions and to duplicate all returned strings. 
Unfortunately, mono will use the environment to find which configuration file to read for System.Configuration.
Configurations that were set might not have been used, as managed code was seeing nulls. This is how the bug surfaced, it
is not hypothetical. Users who set a custom configuration file (via MONO_CFG_DIR) are encouraged to check that using 
previously-ignored configuration files does not lead to unexpected breakage.
