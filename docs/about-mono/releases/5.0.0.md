**THIS IS A DRAFT/WORK IN PROGRESS PLACEHOLDER OF THE 5.0 RELEASE NOTES**

Preview Releases
================

Highlights
==========

In Depth

Runtime
-------

### SIMD Acceleration support ###

Generating SIMD accelerated native code for the classes in the
Mono.Simd assembly is deprecated in this release, and it will be
removed in +2 releases. Users should transition to using the Vector
classes, which are part of the official .net class libraries.

Windows
-------

macOS
=====

The Mono.framework package that we distribute for macOS now uses the
AppleTLS stack for implementing our SSL/TLS transport.  This brings
full support for TLS 1.2 for `SslStream` and our various HTTP web
clients.

We do offer a way of using the old SSL/TLS stack, set the
`MONO_TLS_PROVIDER` environment variable to `legacy` to use the old
Mono managed TLS 1.0 stack.   From your shell, you can do it like this:

```
export MONO_TLS_PROVIDER=legacy
```

CoreFX + Reference Source Adoption
----------------------------------

As we [announced](http://www.mono-project.com/news/2016/11/29/mono-code-sharing/) we are adopting
a new strategy to share code with .NET.   With this release we started this effort where the
code is shared between .NET Core and Mono and not just the Reference Source release.
