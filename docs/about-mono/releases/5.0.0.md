**THIS IS A DRAFT/WORK IN PROGRESS PLACEHOLDER OF THE 5.0 RELEASE NOTES**

Preview Releases
================

Highlights
==========

In Depth
========

Runtime
-------

### SIMD Acceleration support ###

Generating SIMD accelerated native code for the classes in the
Mono.Simd assembly is deprecated in this release, and it will be
removed in +2 releases. Users should transition to using the Vector
classes, which are part of the official .net class libraries.

Windows
-------

The build system was fixed so it works without setting the `git config --global core.autocrlf input`
setting which makes building Mono on Windows easier.

macOS
=====

The Mono.framework package that we distribute for macOS now uses the
AppleTLS stack for implementing our SSL/TLS transport.  This brings
full support for TLS 1.2 for `SslStream` and our various HTTP web
clients.

We do offer a way of using the old SSL/TLS stack, set the
`MONO_TLS_PROVIDER` environment variable to `legacy` to use the old
Mono managed TLS 1.0 stack.   From your shell, you can do it like this:

```
export MONO_TLS_PROVIDER=legacy
```

xbuild/msbuild
--------------

Added support for targeting .NET 4.6.2. In the next release we'll be
updating the reference assemblies so we're matching the APIs
that can be targeted for all .NET profiles.

pdb2mdb
-------

The `pdb2mdb` tool was updated so it no longer crashes when run against
an assembly that has a Portable PDB next to it.

Deprecation of old NUnit 2.4
----------------------------

Mono used to ship with a forked copy of NUnit 2.4 that we used for testing Mono itself.
For historical reasons it was never updated and is ancient at this point (it was released nearly 10 years ago!).
We moved to nunitlite for testing Mono so we decided to deprecate the version we ship.

The `nunit-console` command and compiling against the NUnit DLLs from GAC will print a warning now.
We recommend that you use a recent version of NUnit from NuGet or the project's website instead.

CoreFX + Reference Source Adoption
----------------------------------

As we [announced](http://www.mono-project.com/news/2016/11/29/mono-code-sharing/) we are adopting
a new strategy to share code with .NET.   With this release we started this effort where the
code is shared between .NET Core and Mono and not just the Reference Source release.

Bug Fixes
=========

Environment Memory Management And System.Configuration
------------------------------------------------------
As per the Unix specification, getenv may return a pointer into static memory. Future calls to getenv can overwrite
the memory returned from previous calls to getenv. Mono kept many pointers into this memory while concurrently calling
getenv on multiple threads. We now lock around the environment-changing functions and to duplicate all returned strings. 
Unfortunately, mono will use the environment to find which configuration file to read for System.Configuration.
Configurations that were set might not have been used, as managed code was seeing nulls. This is how the bug surfaced, it
is not hypothetical. Users who set a custom configuration file (via MONO_CFG_DIR) are encouraged to check that using 
previously-ignored configuration files does not lead to unexpected breakage.
