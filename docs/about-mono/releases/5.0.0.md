**THIS IS A DRAFT/WORK IN PROGRESS PLACEHOLDER OF THE 5.0 RELEASE NOTES**

Preview Releases
================

Highlights
==========

In Depth
========

Runtime
-------

### SIMD Acceleration support ###

Generating SIMD accelerated native code for the classes in the
Mono.Simd assembly is deprecated in this release, and it will be
removed in +2 releases. Users should transition to using the Vector
classes, which are part of the official .net class libraries.

### Internal Documentation ###

We have enabled Doxygen for [documentation of runtime internals](http://www.mono-project.com/api/).
Going forward, this should help us onboard new contributors
and make the codebase easier to navigate and understand.

### Static Analysis ###

We are investing in static analysis of the runtime to verify our use
of locks, signals, and global state. This should help reduce
concurrency errors, improving correctness and stability. As a first
step, we have already caught some locking errors in the garbage
collector.

### SIMD Register Scanning ###

Certain compiler optimizations can lead to object references being
stored in SIMD registers, for example, during an optimized copy of an
array of references. Previously, the runtime did not scan these
registers, which could cause objects to be prematurely freed if the
garbage collector happened to run while the only reference to an
object resided in such a register. The runtime now correctly scans
these registers for object references during garbage collection.

### SGen Quicksort ###

SGen uses an optimized custom implementation of quicksort to improve
the performance of some GC operations. Previously, it selected a poor
choice of pivot, which could lead to worst-case time complexity in
some circumstances. It has been rewritten with an improved pivot
strategy.

Windows
-------

macOS
=====

The Mono.framework package that we distribute for macOS now uses the
AppleTLS stack for implementing our SSL/TLS transport.  This brings
full support for TLS 1.2 for `SslStream` and our various HTTP web
clients.

We do offer a way of using the old SSL/TLS stack, set the
`MONO_TLS_PROVIDER` environment variable to `legacy` to use the old
Mono managed TLS 1.0 stack.   From your shell, you can do it like this:

```
export MONO_TLS_PROVIDER=legacy
```

CoreFX + Reference Source Adoption
----------------------------------

As we [announced](http://www.mono-project.com/news/2016/11/29/mono-code-sharing/) we are adopting
a new strategy to share code with .NET.   With this release we started this effort where the
code is shared between .NET Core and Mono and not just the Reference Source release.


Bug Fixes
=========

Environment Memory Management And System.Configuration
------------------------------------------------------
As per the Unix specification, getenv may return a pointer into static memory. Future calls to getenv can overwrite
the memory returned from previous calls to getenv. Mono kept many pointers into this memory while concurrently calling
getenv on multiple threads. We now lock around the environment-changing functions and to duplicate all returned strings. 
Unfortunately, mono will use the environment to find which configuration file to read for System.Configuration.
Configurations that were set might not have been used, as managed code was seeing nulls. This is how the bug surfaced, it
is not hypothetical. Users who set a custom configuration file (via MONO_CFG_DIR) are encouraged to check that using 
previously-ignored configuration files does not lead to unexpected breakage.
