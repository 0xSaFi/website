In Depth
========


Experimental Default Interface Methods Support
----------------------------------------------

We added experimental support for the current prototype.
XXX Check this and that for more info. 


Class Libraries
---------------

### System.Numerics.Vectors

Multiple fixes and new intrinsics added. The library is now considered ready for general usage.

Runtime
-------

### Optimized Array Stores

Added a fast path for storing on array of reference values when the stored value is of the same type of the array element type.

### Class Initialization Improvements

Do hold any runtime locks while running the class initializer. This improves startup scalability.

### Reduced minor collection pause times 

Made the runtime tables used to store reflection information generational, so the GC can avoid scanning them during minor collections.
Those tables can become significantly large on workloads like Visual Studio for Mac.

### Interpreter passes the majority of the JIT test suite

Major progress was made on the interpreter front. It can now run non-trivial programs.


Misc
----

### Internal Documentation

We're publishing internal docs for mono on XXX
