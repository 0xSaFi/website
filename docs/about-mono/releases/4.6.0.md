### POTENTIALLY - TLS

We have added a new implementation of TLS that supports TLS up to
version 1.2 (the old version only supported up to 1.0).  This is a
completely new implementation, and given that it is new, we do not
currently default to it, but we hope to switch to it in the future.

We have an implementation switcher on both the `SslStream` and
`HttpListener` classes.  The default implementation of `SslStream` for now
continues to be the old Mono TLS implementation, the one that supports
SSL and up to TLS 1.0.  But it is now possible to switch the
implementation to either our new managed implementation or any
implementation built on top of something else.

You can control this with the `MONO_TLS_PROVIDER` environment variable.
The possible settings are as follows:

* `default` - let Mono choose the best implementation available for the
platform, currently this is hardcoded to the old implementation, but
we will change this once we complete the audit of our TLS stack, and
we might change this on a per-platform basis to use SslStream
implementations that use some native library.

* `oldtls` - Mono’s historical implementation, it only goes up to TLS 1.0.

* `newtls` - Mono’s new managed implementation, it supports TLS 1.0 up to
1.2

* Any full typename - You can specify a fully qualified .NET Type, this
can be used to test alternative implementations without changing
Mono’s runtime: `MONO_TLS_PROVIDER="Mono.Security.Providers.NewTls.NewTlsProvider,
Mono.Security.Providers.NewTls, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=84e3aee7225169c2`

For custom implementations, the type should subclass the
`Mono.Security.Interface.MonoTlsProvider` interface from the
`Mono.Security` assembly and have a public parameterless constructor.
