### POTENTIALLY - TLS

We have added a new implementation of TLS that supports TLS up to
version 1.2 (the old version only supported up to 1.0).  This is a
completely new implementation, and given that it is new, we do not
currently default to it, but we hope to switch to it in the future.

We have an implementation switcher on both the `SslStream` and
`HttpListener` classes.  The default implementation of `SslStream` for now
continues to be the old Mono TLS implementation, the one that supports
SSL and up to TLS 1.0.  But it is now possible to switch the
implementation to either our new managed implementation or any
implementation built on top of something else.

You can control this with the `MONO_TLS_PROVIDER` environment variable.
The possible settings are as follows:

* `default` - let Mono choose the best implementation available for the
platform, currently this is hardcoded to the old implementation, but
we will change this once we complete the audit of our TLS stack, and
we might change this on a per-platform basis to use SslStream
implementations that use some native library.

* `oldtls` - Mono’s historical implementation, it only goes up to TLS 1.0.

* `newtls` - Mono’s new managed implementation, it supports TLS 1.0 up to
1.2

* Any full typename - You can specify a fully qualified .NET Type, this
can be used to test alternative implementations without changing
Mono’s runtime: `MONO_TLS_PROVIDER="Mono.Security.Providers.NewTls.NewTlsProvider,
Mono.Security.Providers.NewTls, Version=4.0.0.0, Culture=neutral,
PublicKeyToken=84e3aee7225169c2`

For custom implementations, the type should subclass the
`Mono.Security.Interface.MonoTlsProvider` interface from the
`Mono.Security` assembly and have a public parameterless constructor.

### Mono symbolicate

`mono-symbolicate` requires symbols to convert native and IL offsets into file names and line numbers.
`mono-symbolicate` original version required its caller to provide a stack trace along with the symbols to be used.
The task of mapping a stack trace to the correct symbols was delegated to the caller.
Doing such mapping revealed to be a big usability problem as it was necessary to track the stack trace's assemblies versions externally.

Stack trace format changes were introduced to let `mono-symbolicate` know the symbols of stack traces with:
 - IL offsets, as there was no way of knowing to which version of the managed assembly the IL refers to.
 - Native offsets, as multiple .msym are generated and it was not possible to directly link the stack trace to those symbols.

The problem of mapping a stack trace IL offsets to the correct managed assembly version was fixed by changing a stack frame such as:
```
  at StackTraceDumper.Main () [0x00000] in <filename unknown>:0
```
into one as:
```
  at StackTraceDumper.Main () [0x00000] in <cwa3ec873a838c42c29f4eba7cab7d1dfb>:0
```
Where the hash looking part in between `<>` is the module version ID (MVID) of the assembly module the method belongs to.

The problem of mapping native offsets to the correct .msym version was done by replacing a stack frame such as:
```
  at StackTraceDumper.<Main>m__0 () <0x100e15d50 + 0x00029> in <filename unknown>:0
```
by one as:
```
  at StackTraceDumper.<Main>m__0 () <0x100e15d50 + 0x00029> in <a3ec873a838c42c29f4eba7cab7d1dfb#b37a9d11247b811ffffdaff8090d8a59>:0
```
The new stack frame also displays the MVID but after the `#` it also displays what we named as AOTID, a unique identifier embedded into the AOT compiled assembly.

With the changes above it is possible to know from the stack frames only which symbols versions are to be used in order to symbolicate it.

A symbol directory was also introduced, its purpose is to store managed assemblies into subfolders MVID named and native assemblies into subfolders AOTID named.

`mono-symbolicate` is now able to retrieve the correct symbols versions from the stack trace, and to symbolicate using the symbols in the symbol directory.

The changes greatly improved `mono-symbolicate` usability and eliminated the versioning issues it had before.

For `mono-symbolicate` to work it requires a data structure called compact sequence point to be created and stored while compiling IL to native code.
The purpose of compact sequence points is to map native offsets into IL offset so the runtime can display IL offsets instead of native ones.

The memory overhead of using compact sequence points is about 10% of the compiled native code size.
The time spent compiling increased by 4%, this is usually not an issue, 2ms for whole mscorlib.
With AOT compiled assemblies there is the option of storing compact sequence points externally into .msym files, with no overheads at runtime.
Overall the overheads were considered a small price to pay for the huge benefit of being able to symbolicate any future stack trace as long as the symbols are properly stored.

Mono can still be ran without compact sequence points by doing:
```
MONO_DEBUG=no-compact-seq-points mono Program.exe
```
By doing so Mono runtime will not be able to output IL offsets instead of native ones in the stack traces and `mono-symbolicate` will not work.

`mono-symbolicate` can be found [here](https://github.com/mono/mono/tree/mono-4.6.0-branch/mcs/tools/mono-symbolicate)
